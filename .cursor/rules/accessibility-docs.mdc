# Accessibility Documentation Rules

## File Structure and Location

- Accessibility documentation files should be named `03-accessibility.mdx`
- Files should be placed in `docs/src/documentation/03-components/<component-name>/`
- Component source code is in `packages/orbit-components/src/<component-name>/`
- Component README files are located next to component source code

## File Format and Structure

### Required Frontmatter

```mdx
---
title: Accessibility
redirect_from:
  - /components/<component-name>/accessibility/
---
```

### Document Structure

#### 1. Main Heading

```mdx
## Accessibility
```

#### 2. Introduction Statement

- Start with: "The [ComponentName] component has been designed with accessibility in mind."
- Add any specific context about keyboard navigation or special features

#### 3. Props Documentation

When applicable, document props in tables:

```mdx
| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
```

#### 4. Special Features/Considerations

- Document any specific accessibility features
- Include information about screen reader behavior
- Document any automatic ARIA attribute handling

#### 5. Examples Section

Provide examples with proper JSX syntax highlighting:

```jsx
<Component prop="value">
  Content
</Component>
```

### Content Requirements

#### Accessibility Props

- Document standard aria props specific to the component
- Document if component accepts all aria-* and data-* props (exceptional cases)
- Use kebab-case for aria attribute documentation (e.g., aria-label)
- Include prop descriptions in the component's props table if missing

#### Screen Reader Behavior

- Document how screen readers announce the component
- Provide examples with different prop combinations
- Validate and correct any claims about screen reader announcements

#### Special Cases

- Document asComponent prop if available
- For components with icons, document aria-label requirements
- Specify when certain aria props are required vs optional

### Storybook Integration

1. Review and validate aria-related props in stories
2. Exclude inappropriate aria props from stories
3. Add excluded props to the appropriate exclusion array if needed

### Quality Checks

- Ensure all documented props exist and are correctly typed
- Validate screen reader behavior claims
- Cross-reference with existing accessibility docs for consistency
- Remove outdated or incorrect accessibility information from other locations

### Example Documentation

Each component documentation should include:

1. Basic usage examples
2. Screen reader announcement examples
3. Common use cases with accessibility considerations
4. Edge cases and their proper handling

## Reference Components

Use these components as models for documentation:

- ButtonLink
- TextLink

These components demonstrate:

- Special cases for aria props
- Icon-only scenarios
- Component-specific accessibility requirements
- Prop documentation patterns

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, concise language
2. Focus on practical implementation
3. Always include screen reader behavior descriptions
4. Use consistent terminology across all documentation
5. Provide context for why certain accessibility features are important
6. Use proper markdown formatting for code blocks and tables
7. Keep examples focused and relevant
8. Include translations considerations where applicable

## Documentation Guidelines

### General Rules

1. All accessibility documentation should be moved from README.md to the dedicated accessibility file
2. No accessibility sections should remain in README.md files
3. Each component must have its own accessibility documentation page
4. Documentation must be created only after explicit approval for each component

### Content Validation

1. Document all accessibility-related props:
   - Standard aria props specific to the component
   - Document if component accepts all aria-* and data-* props (exceptional cases)
   - Use kebab-case for aria attribute documentation (e.g., aria-label)
   - Include prop descriptions in the component's props table if missing

2. Screen Reader Behavior:
   - Document how screen readers announce the component
   - Provide examples with different prop combinations
   - Validate and correct any claims about screen reader announcements

3. Special Cases:
   - Document asComponent prop if available
   - For components with icons, document aria-label requirements
   - Specify when certain aria props are required vs optional
