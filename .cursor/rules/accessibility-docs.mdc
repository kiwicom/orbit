# Accessibility Documentation Guidelines

## File Requirements
- Files MUST be named `03-accessibility.mdx`
- Files should be placed in the correct component directory path: `docs/src/documentation/03-components/XX-category/component-name/`

## Document Structure
- Start with a level 2 heading `## Accessibility` (not level 1)
- Include frontmatter with title and redirect:
```
---
title: Accessibility
redirect_from:
  - /components/component-name/accessibility/
---
```
- Use appropriate heading hierarchy throughout

## Content Elements
- Begin with a brief component-specific introduction
- Document ALL accessibility-related props (check implementation for completeness)
- Include `labelClose` prop when relevant to the component
- Describe automatic ARIA attributes and behaviors
- Explain key accessibility considerations relevant to the component
- Provide realistic code examples with screen reader context
- Organize information into logical sections with clear headings

## Prop Documentation
- Use a table format for accessibility props
- Include type, default value, and clear description
- Be thorough - check component implementation to catch all accessibility props

## Writing Approach
- Be conversational yet informative
- Focus on practical implementation over theory
- Explain how assistive technology users experience the component
- Adapt content based on component type and complexity
- Prioritize component-specific guidance over generic guidelines

## Component-Specific Considerations
- For trigger components: explain proper non-interactive implementation
- For components with multiple possible roles: explain selection criteria
- For interactive components: focus on keyboard navigation and focus management
- For complex components: explain assistive technology interaction patterns
- For complex widgets (date pickers, autocomplete, etc.): focus on comprehensive keyboard navigation and complex ARIA patterns

Remember that effective accessibility documentation adapts to the component rather than following a rigid structure.
