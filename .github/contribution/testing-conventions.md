# Component testing conventions

For testing Orbit components we're using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/). We expect every new component to have tests, so be sure to familiarize yourself with this library. This document provides some conventions we follow when writing tests.

## Test format

Test files should generally consist of one root `describe` block which is named after the unit that you're testing, containing multiple `it` blocks which should generally start with `should`, so that test names read like sentences. Sometimes you want to nest another `describe` block within the root one to group multiple `it` blocks related to the same aspect of the unit.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

import Button from "../";

describe("Button", () => {
  it("should be accessible", () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Click me" })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it("should trigger the click handler", () => {
    const onClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={onClick}>Click me</Button>);
    userEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Click me" }));
    expect(onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
  describe("when disabled", () => {
    it("should not trigger the click handler", () => {
      const onClick = jest.fn();
      render(
        <Button onClick={onClick} disabled>
          Click me
        </Button>,
      );
      userEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Click me" }));
      expect(onClick).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
```

## Prefer `ByRole` queries

Unless you're asserting that `dataTest` prop is being passed correctly, prefer [`ByRole`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries#byrole) queries, that way you can test behavior and accessibility at the same time.

## Pass literal props directly

It's not necessary to save every prop value in a variable just because you're asserting it later, only save objects like `onClick` because you need the reference to test it:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

import Button from "../";

describe("Button", () => {
  it("default", () => {
    const onClick = jest.fn();
    render(
      <Button onClick={onClick}>
        Click me {/* it's not necessary to save this into a variable */}
      </Button>,
    );
    const button = screen.getByRole("button");
    userEvent.click(button);
    expect(button).toHaveTextContent("Click me"); // you can just repeat it
    expect(onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

## Browser compatibility

This part of testing is often abandoned by people, but we are aware of how important this is for users. Itâ€™s recommended that you test your new components across different platforms and browsers. New components should work on these browsers:
