# Dictionary
We added support to our own dictionary. It handles common translations in components like `Close` 

You have available our dictionary in `@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/data/dictionary/...`
There are files which contains our own translations.

**Example:**
```jsx
import en_GB from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/data/dictionary/en-GB.json"; 
import ThemeProvider from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/ThemeProvider";
import Tooltip from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Tooltip";
import Heading from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Heading";

const App = () => 
  <ThemeProvider dictionary={en_GB}>
    <Tooltip content="Write your text here. If it’s longer than three li…">
      <Heading>
        Orbit design system
      </Heading>
    </Tooltip>
  </ThemeProvider>;
```

**Fallbacks**

* If translation key not exists in your language the fallback is `en_GB` which is our default lang
* If translation key not exists in both files (your language, default language), the translation key will be rendered e.g. `button_close`

**Your own dictionary**

There is option to add your own dictionary, just pass object containing keys and values.

```jsx
import ThemeProvider from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/ThemeProvider";

const App = () => 
  <ThemeProvider dictionary={{
    "button_close": "My own translation"
  }}>
    <Button type="secondary" size="large" />
  </ThemeProvider>;
```
