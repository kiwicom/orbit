## What are design tokens?

Orbit design tokens could be considered as a simple way to describe, document
and use the visual language of Orbit design system.
They represent our design decisions
like the value of color, typography attributes, breakpoints, spacings, etc.

## Organization

We organize design tokens based on their planned and possible usage variety.
Therefore we have two main levels of design tokens:
**global design tokens** and **component specific design tokens**.

### Global design tokens

The global level of our design tokens represents the core
and main level of properties that can be used globally,
in most use cases. It also describes the majority of the [foundation](/foundation).

### Component specific design tokens

On the other hand,
component specific design tokens represent properties
associated with a component or component group.

They should be used only for their intended components and variants.
