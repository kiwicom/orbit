## Table

The Table component has been designed with accessibility in mind, and it can be used with keyboard navigation.

### Scope attribute in the TableCell component

If the `as` prop is set to `"th"`, it's possible to set the `scope` prop to identify whether a table header is a column header or a row header.
You can find more information about the usage in the [official documentation of the scope property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableCellElement/scope).

```jsx
<TableRow>
  <TableCell as="th" scope="row">
    Freja MÃ¸ller
  </TableCell>
  <TableCell>39</TableCell>
  <TableCell>freja21@example.com</TableCell>
</TableRow>
```

Screen readers will recognize markup structured like this, and allow their users to read out the entire column or row at once, for example.
