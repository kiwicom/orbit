## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="InputSelect" />

## Behavior

### Use for many options

InputSelect works well to present many different options in a compact unit.
By allowing users to type to filter options, they don't have to scroll through tens of options to find what they're looking for.

If the amount of options isn't so big and/or it's expected that the user goes through all of them before making a choice, consider using the traditional [Select](/components/select/) component instead.
