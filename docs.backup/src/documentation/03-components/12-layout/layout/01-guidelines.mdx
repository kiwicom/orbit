<ReactExample exampleId="Layout-search" />

## When to use

To choose the best component for your use case, see our [developing layouts guide](/development/guides/developing-layouts/).

- To ensure designs don't break at different sizes.
- To use a predefined or your own layout to show content in the right place at any size.

## When not to use

- For more control over what appears on different screen sizes---use a
  [Hide component](/components/responsive/hide/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Layout" />

## Behavior

<ResponsiveSimilarContentSnippet />

When choosing a layout with columns that change,
make sure the same content appears no matter the width.

Use progressive disclosure to keep content close by.
Consider a [Hide component](/components/responsive/hide/) to vary what appears in each column.

## Look & feel

### Common properties

In all of the layouts, there is one column designed to hold the main content.
There's always a maximum width defined
so it doesn't cover the entire width of large screens.
And all of the content is centered in the middle of the screen.

### Different layouts

#### Booking layout

The Booking layout is a two-column layout on larger screens.
On smaller screens, the second column is placed underneath the first.

<ReactExample exampleId="Layout-booking" />

### MMB layout

The MMB layout is a one-column layout.

<ReactExample exampleId="Layout-mmb" />

### Search layout

The Search layout is a three-column layout on larger screens. On smaller screens, the columns are placed below each other.

<ReactExample exampleId="Layout-search" />
