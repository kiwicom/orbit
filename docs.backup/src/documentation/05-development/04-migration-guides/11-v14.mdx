# Orbit Migration Guide v14

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v13 to v14.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### BaggageStepper component removed

The `BaggageStepper` component was undocumented and had no signs of usage. It was removed. The component `Stepper` can be used to achieve the same functionality.

### Removed deprecated components

The components `Desktop`, `Mobile` and `KeyValue` were deprecated in v10 and are now removed. The [v10 migration guide](/migration-guides/v10/) includes the recommended alternatives for these components.
The component `ClickOutside` was deprecated in v9 and is now removed. The [v9 migration guide](/migration-guides/v9/) includes the recommended alternative for this component.

### Removed deprecated internal utilities

The `toggleUp` and `toggleDown` utilities were removed. They were only meant to be used internally but are not needed anymore.
