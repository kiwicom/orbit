# Orbit Migration Guide v11

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v10.3.0 to v11.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
The best part is, migrating to v11 is incredibly simple!
We've streamlined the process to ensure a smooth transition, making it easier than ever to benefit from the latest enhancements.

## Breaking changes

### Select has no longer `readOnly` property

The `readOnly` property was passed directly to the native HTML select element as an
attribute, which is not supported:

> The attribute is not supported or relevant to select or input types that are already not mutable, such as checkbox and radio. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly))

### Textarea has no longer `size` property

The `size` property has been removed from the `Textarea` component to align it with other input
components that have also had the `size` property removed.

### Separator updates

#### `color` property now accept Tailwind color class

The `color` property of `Separator` component now accepts only Tailwind color classes, e.g. **color="border-blue-normal"**, **color="border-product-normal"**, etc.
Before it was accepting string values in form of Orbit palette tokens, e.g. **color="paletteProductNormal"**.

```jsx
// before
<Separator color="paletteProductNormal" type="solid" />
// after
<Separator color="border-product-normal" />
```

#### `indent` property renamed to `sideOffset`

The `indent` property of `Separator` component was renamed to `sideOffset` to better reflect its behaviour.

```jsx
// before
<Separator indent="large" align="left" />
// after
<Separator sideOffset="large" align="left" />
```

#### `type` property is now set to "solid" by default

Previously, you had to explicitly set the `type` property to "solid" to use a custom color for the Separator.
Now, it's no longer required as the `type` property defaults to "solid".
