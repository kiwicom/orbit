<Illustration name="Feedback" alt="" size="display" />

We're open about as many things as possible.
We work to **build trust** to create productive, long-lasting relationships.

This means being open about our decisions and the factors that influence them.
We don't share **anything** that users have shared with us in confidence.
Sharing private user information violates the trust that we want to develop.

We share what we do, including [our open source software](https://github.com/kiwicom),
and why we do it.
We don't share private data.

## Be public by default

When there's space, share the reasons for decisions and options.
When there are problems, clearly communicate how we're working to fix them.

## Make consequences clear

Use clear language and present clear consequences (don't add fluff around them).

## Be honest

Never lie to anyone for any reason.
