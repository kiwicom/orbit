These guidelines follow our [Voice & tone](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone/) principles and help us keep writing across Kiwi.com consistent. Use them to check on details (like spelling) when you write in our official language, American English, and save energy to focus on getting your content right.

## Active and passive voice

Write in the **active voice** whenever you can.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- (You can) download your boarding pass.
- We added your baggage.

</Do>

<Dont>

- Your boarding pass can be downloaded.
- Baggage has been added.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

Use passive voice only when you want to avoid blaming someone or when the subject is less important than what happened.

<Guideline type="do" title="Do, depending on context">

- It‚Äôs not possible to book this flight. / We couldn‚Äôt book this flight.
- Baggage is included. / Booking includes baggage.

</Guideline>

## Spelling

Kiwi.com‚Äôs official language is American English, so use American spelling.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- canceled (but cancellation)
- traveler
- apologize

</Do>

<Dont>

- cancelled
- traveller
- apologise

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

Always include diacritics if they're there:

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Oliver Dlouh√Ω, Petra Va≈°kov√Ωch

</Do>

<Dont>

- Oliver Dlouhy, Petra Vaskovych

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Contractions

Use contractions freely to [sound natural](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone/empathetic/#use-words-and-structures-youd-use-in-speaking) and avoid being robotic or overly formal.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- I‚Äôll check it for you.

</Do>

<Dont>

- I will check it for you.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

But there are some exceptions where the full form is appropriate. For example, if you need to stress something **is not** possible or to be more formal.

## Abbreviations and acronyms

Only use common abbreviations and acronyms.

<Guideline type="do" title="Do">

- UK
- UTC
- COVID-19

</Guideline>

If something isn‚Äôt common, spell it out or explain it first.

<Guideline type="do" title="Do">

- carrier reservation number (PNR)

</Guideline>

## Capitalization

### Sentence case

Use **sentence case** in all of your writing. Capitalize only the first word in sentences, headings, buttons, emails, etc. Don't capitalize after a dash or colon in titles or lists.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Manage my trip / Manage trip
- Your booking is confirmed
- Reminder: add your details

</Do>

<Dont>

- Manage My Trip
- Your Booking Is Confirmed
- Reminder: Add Your Details

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

### Title case

Capitalize **proper nouns, legal terms**, and **product names** according to their own rules, and also **names of sections or buttons** when referring to them.

<Guideline type="do" title="Brand names">

- easyJet
- Wizz Air
- British Airways

</Guideline>

<Guideline type="do" title="Legal terms">

- Terms & Conditions
- Privacy Policy

</Guideline>

<Guideline type="do" title="Referring to sections or buttons">

- Click **Refunds & cancellations**

</Guideline>

### All caps

Don‚Äôt use all caps unless they‚Äôre a part of the design and **never use them to emphasize a point**.

- To emphasize text, use **bold** instead.

## Plural vs. singular

Use plural by default if there can't be multiple versions of the copy.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Carriers don‚Äôt offer any refunds.
- Your boarding passes will be ready soon.

</Do>

<Dont>

- Carrier(s) don‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt offer any refunds.
- Your boarding pass/es will be ready soon.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

If it‚Äôs important to specifically mention that there may be one or multiple items, use the phrase ‚Äúone or more‚Äù.

## Punctuation

### Ampersands

Use ‚Äúand‚Äù instead of ‚Äú&‚Äù in longer texts as it improves [readability](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/ampersands/) and therefore is more [inclusive](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone/inclusive/).

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- You‚Äôll need a visa and a PCR test to travel to your destination.

</Do>

<Dont>

- You‚Äôll need a visa & a PCR test to travel to your destination.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

But there are a few exceptions if you need to save space, especially in titles and buttons.

<Guideline type="do" title="Do">

- Refunds & cancellations
- Help & support
- Overview & payment

</Guideline>

### Commas

Use commas to mimic speech ‚Äî to add a pause where it‚Äôd naturally occur or to separate or highlight parts of a sentence.

Don‚Äôt use commas if they don‚Äôt serve a purpose, for example after ‚Äúplease‚Äù or before and after ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äú in the middle of a sentence.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Please add your details.
- We unfortunately can‚Äôt help.
- Hi John,‚Ä¶

</Do>

<Dont>

- Please, add your details.
- We, unfortunately, can‚Äôt help.
- Hi, John,‚Ä¶

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

If you need to list multiple items, use a serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma).

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Plane, bus, and train

</Do>

<Dont>

- Plane, bus and train

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

</Do>

<Dont>

### Exclamation points

Never use multiple exclamation points in a row, and avoid using them in longer sentences altogether.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Your booking is ready!

</Do>

<Dont>

- You saved a new password!
- We have tickets for ‚Ç¨5! Book now!!!

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

### Interrobang, ellipsis, and other unusual punctuation

The rule of thumb for using unusual punctuation is: don‚Äôt. If you do, you should make a case for it.

<Guideline type="dont" title="Don't">

- Don‚Äôt want to miss this deal?!
- Check this out...

</Guideline>

### Symbols and spaces

If an item has a symbol or an official abbreviation, use it instead of spelling it out.

- 7 kg
- 3 √ó
- 0 ¬∫C
- ‚Ç¨ 20
- 40√ó56√ó29cm

- 1-hour flight
- co-traveler

</Guideline>

Use an **en-dash (‚Äì)** without spaces to talk about ranges of numbers (like times or dates).

But when you write about locations, replace the en-dash with an arrow (**‚Üí, ‚áÑ**) wherever possible and use spaces before and after the arrow.

<Guideline type="do" title="Do">

- 12:30‚Äì14:35

<Guideline type="do" title="Do">

</Guideline>

### Emojis

Use emojis sparingly to attract your reader‚Äôs attention or emphasize a (positive) feeling, but never to replace words or as the only way to express emotion.

## Lists

Use lists to present steps or sets of information ideally consisting of 3 or 5 bullet points ‚Äî if you have more points, consider a table.

Make sure that the items on the list have a parallel structure and context, especially if you create a list of pros and cons.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

</Guideline>

## Pronouns

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- You can book a new trip.

</Do>

<Dont>

- It‚Äôs possible to book a new trip. / The customer can book a new trip.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

When your readers need to perform an action, like click on a button, choose an answer to a question we‚Äôve asked, or provide legal consent, use the first person ‚Äî **me, I, my**.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Manage my trip / Manage trip

## Sentence structure

Write **short sentences** and put essential info first. Short sentences improve readability. They‚Äôre more powerful. They value your reader‚Äôs time.

Long sentences that run on and on and are full of commas, colons, and semicolons ‚Äî and many different clauses ‚Äî are really confusing and awkward to read for even the strongest readers ‚Äî just imagine receiving an email with sentences stretching through multiple paragraphs, as long and winding as this one; it‚Äôs an impossible read that most people just can‚Äôt get through and either scan through it or skip it completely on a busy day ‚Äî and let‚Äôs be honest, every day is a busy day, especially when traveling.

Use a text editor like [hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com/) if you‚Äôre not sure how complex your text is.

## Word choice

Always use words and phrases that are easily understandable. Don‚Äôt use extra words that don‚Äôt serve a purpose.

üí° Check our [glossary](/kiwi-use/content/glossary/) for the list of common words we use across [Kiwi.com](http://Kiwi.com)\_.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- buy
- speed up
- We'll need your details.

</Do>

<Dont>

- purchase
- expedite
- Please be advised that we will need your details.

</Dont>

</GuidelinesSideBySide>

When possible, use informal short forms of the words depending on the context and space. Short forms sound more natural and are especially useful for buttons.

- OK / okay

</Guideline>
