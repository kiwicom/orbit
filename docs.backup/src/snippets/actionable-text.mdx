### Use actionable text

It should be clear from the button text exactly what happens when the user interacts with it.
The labels should be actionable, such as "Add passenger" and "Book for (price)".

Avoid long explanations in the button text.
The text should be short and clear.
If additional explanation is needed, add it above the button as text.
