import Palette from "../components/Palette";

You can usually have icons inherit their color from the surrounding text.
If you need a standalone icon, select from a [status color](/foundation/color/#status-colors)
or one of our icon colors:

<Palette colors={["colorIconPrimary", "colorIconSecondary", "colorIconTertiary"]} />
