### Present info nonvisually

Illustrations can add a lot to your designs.
So you need to make sure everything necessary is presented to
[people who don't see the illustration](/foundation/accessibility/) as alternative text.

Meaningful alternative text includes the **context** and **function** of the illustration.
Make sure everything you want users to know to continue in the flow is available to them.

You can include alternative text through means like the `alt` attribute.
Or you can present necessary alternative text next to the illustration
as [text](/components/text/text/) or [headings](/components/text/heading/),
in which case you can set the `alt` attribute to an empty string.

If an illustration is only for decoration,
leave the alternative text **blank**.
Providing a description just gives users extra information that doesn't help them.
