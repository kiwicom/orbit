You can set two things about illustrations.
The first is the illustration itself,
which you can choose from the [complete list of illustrations](#available-illustrations).

The second is the size.
We have five different sizes to offer, which are based around the maximum height of the illustration.

<ul>
  <li>Extra small ({defaultTheme.orbit.heightIllustrationSmall})</li>
  <li>Small (120 px)</li>
  <li>Medium ({defaultTheme.orbit.heightIllustrationMedium})</li>
  <li>Large (280 px)</li>
  <li>Display (460 px)</li>
</ul>
