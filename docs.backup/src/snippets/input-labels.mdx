### Use labels

Labels serve to clearly present what's expected.
They're especially important for [people who don't see other visual cues](/foundation/accessibility/).
But they also help everyone know exactly what to enter.

For the label, use short descriptive phrases,
ideally nouns that make the request clear.
See our [patterns for form labels](/kiwi-use/content/glossary/#form-labels) for some examples.
