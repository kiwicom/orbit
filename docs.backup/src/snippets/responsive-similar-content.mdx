### Offer similar content to everyone

Users approach their interactions with your content similarly no matter their device.
They're looking for information or to accomplish a task.
If a user can't find that information or feature on your mobile site or app,
they assume you don't have it.

Make sure your content is available everywhere.
Change its form so it fits best in the space available
and fits user expectations for the device.
But keep it present.
