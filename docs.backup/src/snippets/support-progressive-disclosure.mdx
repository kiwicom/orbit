### Support progressive disclosure

While it makes sense to provide users with the information they need to make a good choice,
providing them with too much information at once actually makes it harder to decide.

So while you might be tempted to stuff everything into labels and additional info,
you should try to use [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/).
This means using [text links](/components/action/textlink/) and [tooltips](/components/overlay/tooltip/)
to keep info hidden but close by.
