Everything you need to start designing with Orbit UI kit.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi Kiwi.com designer.

Set up your computer to be effective with Orbit.

## Tooling

We use Figma for all our entire design workflow.
Since it's a larger topic, we've set up a set of guides on [working with Figma](https://orbit.kiwi/?page_id=7603).

- If you run into any issues, use the **\#plz-figma** channel on Slack.

## Fonts

Visit ourÂ [Google Drive fonts folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPfejT5Z0OQpSRyv4Ul4jFdlgXP-Chij) and install the Roboto and Circular Pro fonts.
(You need access rights to the Kiwi.com Design Group.)

If you plan to use Orbit in your non-Kiwi.com projects,
you can also download the fonts fromÂ [Google Fonts repository](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
If you want to use Circular Pro, don't forget toÂ [buy a license](https://lineto.com/the+fonts/font+categories/text+fonts/circular/)Â for your domains.

## Use plugins to be more effective

You need to be careful with plugins as they sometimes slow down your work, rather than speeding it up.
But here are some Figma plugins that should make you even more effective and shouldn't create any major issues.

### Autoflow

An essential plugin to show flows in your groups.
This makes it easy to connect screens into a clear flow with a single hotkey.
