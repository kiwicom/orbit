**`Orbit-components` is a React component library to help developers build travel products.**

---

## Orbit Mission

Orbit aims to bring order and consistency to all of our products and processes.
We elevate the user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products.

## Installation

`orbit-components` is served as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kiwicom/orbit-components).

Add them to your project by running:

```shell
// with npm
npm install @kiwicom/orbit-components

// with yarn
yarn add @kiwicom/orbit-components
```

Don't forget to also install [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/) `^4.0.0`.

## Usage

1. Import the fonts that are used in `orbit-components`:

   ```html
   <link
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,400i,500,500i,700"
     rel="stylesheet"
   />
   ```

   Or via CSS:

   ```css
   @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,400i,500,500i,700");
   ```

2. Include any of our components in your project and use it:

   ```jsx
   import Alert from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Alert";

   <Alert>Hello World!</Alert>;
   ```

If you want to use a custom theme or dictionary inside your project,
it's necessary to wrap your app in `<OrbitProvider>`.
See [more info about the Orbit provider](/utilities/orbit-provider/).

For a live preview, check out our [Storybook](https://kiwicom.github.io/orbit/) or [orbit.kiwi](https://orbit.kiwi).

You can also try `orbit-components` live on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/designkiwicom/orbit-sandbox).

## Types

Orbit comes with both Flow and Typescript definition files, so you can choose what fits your project.
If you're working with Typescript, you need to add a type for `styled-components`.

```shell
// with npm
npm install @types/styled-components --save-dev

// with yarn
yarn add @types/styled-components -D
```
