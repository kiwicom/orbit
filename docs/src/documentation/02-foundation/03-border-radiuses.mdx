title: Border radiuses
description: What border radiuses are used within Orbit
---

There is a difference between our border radiuses on desktop and mobile.
Currently, we use a **3px** border radius **on desktop** and **6px** **on mobile**.

**The border radius for desktop is smaller intentionally**
because placing elements close to one another would cause a visual imbalance.

The most common example is a group of form elements with small spacing between fields.
It's clear at first sight that these fields would be less visually connected
with 6px border radiuses than with 3px ones.
