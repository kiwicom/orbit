title: Installation
---

If you're already using `@kiwicom/orbit-components`,
you don't need to install the tokens
because they're included as a dependency to ensure compatibility,
see [usage with `@kiwicom/orbit-components`](#usage-with-kiwicomorbit-components).

If not, you can install the package on its own.

```shell
# Using npm
npm install --save @kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens

# Using yarn
yarn add @kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens
```

## Usage without @kiwicom/orbit-components

Once installed in your codebase,
you can use our design tokens in JavaScript environment
by simply importing them.

```js
import { defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens";
```

The `defaultTheme` object contains all design tokens
that are available for every usage.

```js
/*
  The content of defaultTheme object
*/
{
  ...,
  fontFamily: "Roboto",
  fontSizeSmall: "12px",
  fontSizeNormal: "14px",
  fontSizeLarge: "16px",
  ...
}
```

Use this only in cases when you don't need to also work with `@kiwicom/orbit-components`.

## Usage with @kiwicom/orbit-components

To be able to use our design tokens together with Orbit React components,
we highly recommend using import from the components package,
instead of from design tokens.

```js
import { defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-components";
```

There is one minor difference:
`defaultTheme` contains a few more things
that we use for creating more advanced and scalable user interfaces.

```js
/*
  The content of defaultTheme object
*/
{
  rtl: true,
  transitions: true,
  lockScrolling: true,
  lockScrollingBarGap: true,
  orbit: {
    ...,
    fontFamily: "Roboto",
    fontSizeSmall: "12px",
    fontSizeNormal: "14px",
    ...
  }
}
```

Since `@kiwicom/orbit-components` is build upon the `styled-components` CSS-in-JS library,
it's necessary to work with a theming (styling) context across the whole application.

To be able to use the same `theme` context object with same value
across the whole application
we encourage users to wrap the whole application into Orbit's `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-components";

const App = ({ children }) => {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
};
```

And, most importantly consuming the `theme`
by accessing the context object
directly inside `styled-components`.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

export const CustomStyled = styled.div`
  background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.orbit.paletteWhite};
`;
```

This approach enables easier consistency
when working and consuming Orbit's foundation,
tokenized by `@kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens`.
Lastly, it also provides a better and easier way
of adding a custom theme to your application.
