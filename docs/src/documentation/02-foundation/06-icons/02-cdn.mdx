<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->

You can download a PNG file for any Orbit icon at the following address:
[https://images.kiwi.com/orbit-icons/{type}/{size}/{name}.png](https://images.kiwi.com/orbit-icons/success/32x32/airplane.png).

<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->

Fill in the details as follows:

- `{type}` is the style of the icon, represented through color. Choose one of the following:

  - primary
  - secondary
  - tertiary
  - success
  - info
  - warning
  - error
  - white

- `{style}` can be either smaller (`32×32`) or larger (`48×48`).
- `{name}` is the kebab-style name of the icon, which you can find in the [icon list](/foundation/icons/#list-of-icons).

So for a success version in large of an airplane icon, you'd use the following address:

<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->

<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->
