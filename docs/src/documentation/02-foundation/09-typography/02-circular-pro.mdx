title: Circular Pro
---

We use Circular Pro as the main typography supported by Orbit.
Circular Pro is the only typeface for western texts and Lato is used for some eastern languages,
with a fallback to system fonts.

## Circular Pro in Kiwi.com projects

We have Circular Pro licensed for Kiwi.com domain,
so there is nothing stopping our designers from working with Circular Pro with all our platforms.

## Circular Pro in non-Kiwi.com projects

You can, of course, use Circular Pro typography with Orbit in any project.
Just be sure that you have
[the right license](https://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/) for your project.
If you can't or don't want to use Circular Pro in your project,
heck our [open-source section for typography](/foundation/typography/open-source/)
where we explain how to use Orbit with Roboto.

## Using Orbit with Circular Pro

In an ideal world,
it should be that easy as changing the value of the <InlineToken name="fontFamily" /> design token
and everything would work automatically.
It's actually not much harder, just a few more steps .

### In React components

#### 1. Insert font files into the page

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//images.kiwi.com/fonts/circular-pro/style.min.css" />
```

#### 2. Change theme object

```jsx
import getTokens from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/getTokens"
import ThemeProvider from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/ThemeProvider"
const customTokens = getTokens({
  base: {
    fontFamily: '"Circular Pro", -apple-system, ".SFNSText-Regular", "San Francisco", "Segoe UI", "Helvetica Neue", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;'
  }
})

<ThemeProvider theme={{orbit: customTokens}}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

### In Figma
