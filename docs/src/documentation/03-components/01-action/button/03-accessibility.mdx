# Accessibility

## Button

The Button component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The following props provide additional information to screen readers:

| Name           | Type      | Description                                                            |
| :------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title          | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute of the component.      |
| ariaLabelledby | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-labelledby` attribute of the component. |
| ariaControls   | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-controls` attribute of the component.   |
| ariaExpanded   | `boolean` | Allows you to specify an `aria-expanded` attribute of the component.   |
| ariaCurrent    | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-current` attribute of the component.    |

While these props are optional, we recommend including them in a correct usage to ensure proper functionality with assistive technologies.

- Use `title` when you need to add extra information to screen readers or there is no `children` presented to be used as label.

- Prop `ariaLabelledby` references the id(s) of element(s) that label(s) the Button, separated by a space. The elements with those ids can be hidden, so that their text is only announced by screen readers to describe the button.

- Use `ariaControls` prop to establish a connection between a Button and an element it controls. The prop accepts a unique `id` of an element.

- The `ariaExpanded` prop is useful to indicate if a related control is expanded or collapsed. This attribute is commonly used in combination with `ariaControls`.

- Use `ariaCurrent` prop to indicate that the Button represents the current item within a set of related Buttons. This prop helps assistive technologies convey the current state of the Button to users.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that button is inactive and they can't interact with it. When `disabled` prop is set to `true`, the button is ignored by a screen reader and not focusable by Tab key.

Also, the component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node:

- The prop `asComponent` can be used to define the HTML element to be rendered. This prop is optional and if it is not provided, the component will render a default (button) element.

- When `href` prop is defined, the component will render as an `a` element.

- Use `role` and `tabIndex` when you are rendering `Button` to non-actionable HTML element as `div` or `span`. However, this should be done only in edge-cases as it is anti-pattern behavior.

## Example

### Example 1:

```jsx
<Button title="Open modal window">Open</Button>
```

In this example, the screen reader will announce the title of the button (`Open modal window`). This is prioritized over text content (`Open`) inside the Button.

### Example 2:

```jsx
<div>
  <h2 id="section-title">Section Title</h2>
  <Button
    title="Expand section"
    ariaLabelledby="section-title"
    ariaControls="section-content"
    ariaExpanded={true}
    ariaCurrent="true"
  >
    Expand
  </Button>
  <div id="section-content">
    <p>This is the content of the section.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the screen reader will announce the title of the section (`Section Title`) and that the section is expanded - section with respective id (`section-content`) is present.

Note that the `title` prop is **not** announced by screen readers.
