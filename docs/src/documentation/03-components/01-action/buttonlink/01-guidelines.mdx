## When to use

If you're unsure what component or type to use for actions, check out our [interactive guide on action components](/guides/using-button-type-components/).

- To offer less important actions users can take.
- To show many possible actions at once.
- When the action is navigation inside the current app.
- If it involves an interaction (like opening a modal or submitting a form).
- With short action text.

### When not to use

- When you have a single action you want to draw attention to---use a [button](/components/action/button/).
- To make text inside paragraphs or lists actionable---use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/).
- For navigation to external sites and services---use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/).
- With a long call to action---use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/).
- So users can sign in using a social service---use a [SocialButton](/components/action/socialbutton/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="ButtonLink" />

## Content structure

![IconLeft: visually supports button visibility; label: describes the main action and works best when short; icon right: shows additional options for the button (expandable, link, etc.).](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:0%3A100)

## Behavior

### Use apart from text

Button links have extra spacing built into them so that they present a large enough
[target size](/foundation/accessibility/#target-sizes) to be usable on smaller screens.
So they have different heights than text and using them in a paragraph would cause visual misalignment.

Use button links only as stand-alone elements.
The extra space around them also helps show they're connected to an action.
If you need links aligned with text, use [text links](/components/action/textlink/).

## ButtonLink types

Button links come in the **three types** (primary, secondary, and critical)
and **three sizes** (large, normal, and small).
