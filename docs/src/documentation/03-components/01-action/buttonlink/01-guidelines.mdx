## When to use

If you're unsure what component or type to use for actions, check out our [interactive guide on action components](/guides/using-button-type-components/).

- To offer less important actions users can take.
- When you want to show many possible actions at once.

### When not to use

- When you have a single action you want to draw attention to---use a [button](/components/action/button/).
- To make text inside paragraphs or lists actionable---use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/).
- So users can sign in using a social service---use a [SocialButton](/components/action/socialbutton/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="ButtonLink" />

## Content structure

![IconLeft: visually supports button visability; label: describes the main action and works best when short; icon right: shows additional options for the button (expandable, link, etc.).](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:0%3A100)

## Behavior

### Use apart from text

Button links have extra spacing built into them so that they present a large enough
[target size](/foundation/accessibility/#target-sizes) to be usable on smaller screens.
So they have different heights than text and using them in a paragraph would cause visual misalignment.

Use button links only as stand-alone elements.
The extra space around them also helps show they're connected to an action.
If you need links aligned with text, use [text links](/components/action/textlink/).

## Content

### Use actionable text

It should be clear from the button text exactly what happens when the user interacts with it.
The labels should be actionable, such as "Add passenger" and "Book for (price)".

Avoid long explanations in the button text.
The text should be short and clear.
If additional explanation is needed,
add it above the button as text.

See [examples for how to make actions clear](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone/straightforward/#make-every-action-clear).

Button links come in the **three types** (primary, secondary, and critical)
and **three sizes** (large, normal, and small).
