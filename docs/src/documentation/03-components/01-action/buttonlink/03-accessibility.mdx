# Accessibility

## ButtonLink

The ButtonLink component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The following props provide additional information to screen readers:

| Name           | Type      | Description                                                            |
| :------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title          | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute of the component.      |
| ariaLabelledby | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-labelledby` attribute of the component. |
| ariaControls   | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-controls` attribute of the component.   |
| ariaExpanded   | `boolean` | Allows you to specify an `aria-expanded` attribute of the component.   |
| ariaCurrent    | `string`  | Allows you to specify an `aria-current` attribute of the component.    |

While these props are optional, we recommend including them in a correct usage to ensure proper functionality with assistive technologies.

- Use `title` when you need to add extra information to screen readers or there is no `children` presented to be used as label.

- Prop `ariaLabelledby` references the id(s) of element(s) that label(s) the ButtonLink, separated by a space. The elements with those ids can be hidden, so that their text is only announced by screen readers to describe the ButtonLink.

- Use `ariaControls` prop to establish a connection between a ButtonLink and an element it controls. The prop accepts a unique `id` of an element.

- The `ariaExpanded` prop is useful to indicate if a related control is expanded or collapsed. This attribute is commonly used in combination with `ariaControls`.

- Use `ariaCurrent` prop to indicate that the ButtonLink represents the current item within a set of related ButtonLinks. This prop helps assistive technologies convey the current state of the ButtonLink to users.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that ButtonLink is inactive and they can't interact with it. When `disabled` prop is set to `true`, the ButtonLink is ignored by a screen reader and not focusable by Tab key.

Also, the component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node:

- The prop `asComponent` can be used to define the HTML element to be rendered. This prop is optional and if it is not provided, the component will render a default (button) element.

- When `href` prop is defined, the component will render as an `a` element. In this case, attributes like `ariaControls` and `ariaExpanded` are generally less relevant since the element behaves as a link rather than a button.

- Use `role` and `tabIndex` when you are rendering `ButtonLink` to non-actionable HTML element as `div` or `span`. However, this should be done only in edge-cases as it is anti-pattern behavior.

- If `external` prop is true, a `noopener` value will be automatically added to the `rel` attribute for security reasons.

## Example

### Example 1:

```jsx
<ButtonLink title="Visit our website" href="https://example.com">
  Visit us
</ButtonLink>
```

In this example, the screen reader will announce the title of the button (`Visit our website`). This is prioritized over text content (`Visit us`) inside the ButtonLink.

### Example 2:

```jsx
<div>
  <h2 id="section-title">User Profile</h2>
  <ButtonLink
    title="Edit user profile"
    ariaLabelledby="section-title"
    ariaControls="profile-editor"
    ariaExpanded={isEditorOpen}
  >
    Edit
  </ButtonLink>
  <div id="profile-editor">
    <p>This is the profile editor.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the screen reader will announce the title of the section (`User Profile`) and whether the profile editor is expanded or collapsed.

Note that the `title` prop is **not** announced by screen readers.
