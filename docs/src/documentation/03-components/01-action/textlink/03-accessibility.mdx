# Accessibility

## TextLink

The TextLink component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The following props provide additional information to screen readers:

| Name        | Type     | Description                                                                                 |
| :---------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ariaCurrent | `string` | Indicates whether the element represents the current item within a set of related elements. |

The TextLink component also accepts all `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes which are passed directly to the underlying element. The most relevant ones include:

| Aria Attribute | Description                                                                  |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| aria-label     | Provides an accessible name for the link when visible text isn't sufficient. |

While these props are optional, we recommend including them in a correct usage to ensure proper functionality with assistive technologies.

- Use `aria-label` when you need to add extra information to screen readers or provide additional clarification about the link's purpose, especially when the TextLink contains only an icon.

- Use `ariaCurrent` prop to indicate that the TextLink represents the current item within a set of related TextLinks. Values can be "page", "step", "location", "date", "time", "true", or "false". This prop helps assistive technologies convey the current state of the TextLink to users.

Also, the component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node:

- The prop `asComponent` can be used to define the HTML element to be rendered. This prop is optional and if it is not provided, the component will render as an anchor (`a`) element. When changing the underlying element, make sure to maintain accessibility by using appropriate ARIA attributes.

- The `href` prop defines the URL to navigate to when the TextLink is clicked. When this prop is not provided, the component will apply appropriate ARIA roles to make it behave like a button for accessibility purposes, setting `role="button"` and ensuring keyboard accessibility with `tabIndex={0}`.

- When `external` prop is true, the link will open in a new tab and a `noopener` value will be automatically added to the `rel` attribute for security reasons.

- The `standAlone` prop is important for accessibility. Setting it to `true` creates a safe clickable area around the link, making it more accessible, particularly when used outside of a block of text.

- The `stopPropagation` prop, when set to `true`, prevents click events from bubbling up the DOM tree, which can be useful when the TextLink is nested inside another clickable element to avoid triggering multiple actions.

- When using TextLink with only an icon and no text, it's essential to add an `aria-label` to provide context to screen reader users about the link's purpose.

## Example

### Example 1:

```jsx
<TextLink href="https://example.com" aria-label="Visit our website homepage">
  Visit our website
</TextLink>
```

In this example, screen readers will announce "Visit our website homepage" as the link's accessible name, providing more context about the link's destination.

### Example 2:

```jsx
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <TextLink href="/home">Home</TextLink> &gt;
  <TextLink href="/products">Products</TextLink> &gt;
  <TextLink href="/products/shoes" ariaCurrent="page">
    Shoes
  </TextLink>
</nav>
```

In this example, the screen reader will announce that "Shoes" represents the current page, helping users understand their current location in the navigation hierarchy.

### Example 3: Icon-only TextLink

```jsx
<TextLink
  href="https://example.com/search"
  aria-label="Search products"
  iconLeft={<Icon type="search" />}
/>
```

In this example, no visible text is provided, only a search icon. The `aria-label` ensures that screen reader users understand the purpose of the link as "Search products" even though there's no visible text.
