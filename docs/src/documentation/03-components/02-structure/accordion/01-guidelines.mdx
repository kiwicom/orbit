## When to use

- You have long sections of content with similar structure,
  such as seat maps for various parts of a trip.
- You want to show only one section at a time
  (to keep users from being overwhelmed using [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/)).

### When not to use

- You want to display all content on the screen at once---use a [card](/components/structure/card/).
- Each section has a single associated action---use a [tile](/components/structure/tile/).
- The information to hide is simple and doesn't have a repeating structure---use a [collapse](/components/interaction/collapse/).

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="813%3A2077"
  alt="Section header: sets the context for the section; section actions: optionally creates actions associated with a section; collapse section: supports progressive disclosure by hiding additional info; expanded section: shows additional info one section at a time; section content: shows one version of content with similar structure; section footer: optionally presents sticky actions for the section."
/>

## Behavior

### Make actions clear

Accordions make content appear and disappear on the screen.
If you're not careful, users may start feeling lost.

Offer clear, persistent actions that make it clear how to get from one section to the next.
And how to get back anything that has disappeared.

## Content

### Use for similar content

Accordion sections aren't visible all of the time.
Users may experience navigating between them as switching context.

Keep users comfortable by offering similar content in each section.
This helps users scan for what they need among all their options.

### Offer concrete headings

Section headings offer context for what each section contains.
Use specific nouns to make it clear what users can expect on opening the section.

## Visual style

### Maintain visual hierarchy

Accordions are open to any content you want to put into them.
Make sure to use a consistent style of heading to keep the overall visual hierarchy.

Using different styles can create conflicting visual messages.
