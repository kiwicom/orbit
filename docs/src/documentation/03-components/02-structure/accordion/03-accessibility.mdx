## Accessibility

The Accordion component has been designed with accessibility in mind, providing collapsible sections that are fully keyboard navigable and screen reader compatible.

### Accessibility Props

**AccordionSection props:**

| Name              | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| expandOnTileClick | `boolean` | `false` | When `true`, makes the entire header area clickable to expand/collapse the section, improving the touch target size for mobile users. |

### Automatic Accessibility Features

- The component automatically manages ARIA attributes when a section is expandable AND `expandOnTileClick` is true:
  - `role="button"` is applied to the header
  - `aria-expanded` is set to `true` or `false` based on the section's expanded state
  - `aria-controls` associates the header with its controlled content section
  - `tabIndex` is set to 0 to include the header in the tab order

### Keyboard Navigation

The Accordion component supports the following keyboard interactions:

- **Enter/Space:** When focus is on a section header with `expandOnTileClick` enabled, pressing Enter or Space will toggle the expansion state
- **Tab:** Moves focus to the next focusable element (header or interactive elements within expanded sections)
- **Shift + Tab:** Moves focus to the previous focusable element

### Best Practices

- Provide descriptive headers that clearly indicate the content of each section
- Consider enabling `expandOnTileClick` for interfaces primarily used on mobile devices
- Interactive elements in the main content area should only be accessible when their section is expanded

### Example

```jsx
<Accordion id="faq-accordion">
  <AccordionSection id="section-1" header="What is Orbit?" expandOnTileClick>
    Orbit is Kiwi.com's design system for creating consistent user experiences across products.
  </AccordionSection>
  <AccordionSection id="section-2" header="How do I use Accordion?" expandOnTileClick>
    Import the Accordion and AccordionSection components and nest the sections within the accordion.
  </AccordionSection>
</Accordion>
```

Screen reader announces: "What is Orbit?, button, collapsed" when focusing on the first section header.
