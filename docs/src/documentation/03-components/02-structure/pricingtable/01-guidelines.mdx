## When to use

- To build user trust with clearly presented choices.
- Let enable users to quickly scan for pricing differences and choose the service that's right for them.

### When not to use

- The information isn't about pricing---use a [table](/components/structure/table/).

## Component status

## Content structure

![Feature icon: helps explain the value proposition of each choice; badge: supports users in the decision process based on real data; tooltip: optionally indicates the text is wrapped with more info; name: helps users navigate through the offer and you should always use the shortest version; feature list: clearly explains differences among choices and can include custom content (usually a list); action buttons: includes equal calls-to-action without highlighting any choice; price: makes price easy to notice for the initial comparison of choices.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:0%3A310)
