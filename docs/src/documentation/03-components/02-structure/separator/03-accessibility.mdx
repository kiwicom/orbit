## Accessibility

The separator component uses a semantic `<hr>` element for visual separation.
The separator itself is not announced by screen readers and cannot be selected or focused.
When a `label` is provided, any text content within the label is announced by screen readers as it's visible content within the separator.

### Examples

```jsx
<Separator label="Account Details" />
```

Screen reader announces: "Account Details".
