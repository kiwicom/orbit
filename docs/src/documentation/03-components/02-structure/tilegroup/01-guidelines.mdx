<ReactExample exampleId="TileGroup-default" />

## When to use

- You have multiple related structured interactions ([tiles](/components/structure/tile/)).
- You want to present the groups as a whole.

### When not to use

- For information without a related action---use a [card](/components/structure/card/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="TileGroup" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="782%3A2502"
  alt="Hovered/focused tile: shows the currently selected action; other tiles: offer other actions to choose from."
/>

## Behavior

### Use for related actions

Tile groups are designed to associate their contents closely.
This means the tiles look similar and connected.

So don't use tile groups for unrelated options.
Use them to present clear choices for the next logical step.

### Keep tiles consistent

To present clear options,
it helps if all of the choices are similar.
This makes scanning for the right one easier.

Use similar structures for all tiles so each action is clear
and users can choose the one that's right for them.

## Look & feel

### Hover/focus

The tiles are associated together within the group and made to look similar.
To make selection clearer, the background changes when a user hovers over/focuses on a tile.

In this way, the current selection is clear and users are less likely to click the wrong action.
