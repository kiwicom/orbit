# Accessibility

## TileGroup

The TileGroup component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node. By default, it will render a `div` element.

If needed, it can be rendered as a list by passing the `as` prop with the value `"ul"`.

In that case, the `Tile` elements used as `children` should be rendered as `li`.

```jsx
<TileGroup as="ul">
  <Tile title="Title" as="li" />
  <Tile title="Title" as="li" />
</TileGroup>
```
