## When to use

- To call attention to details in a way that makes it easy to scan.
- To present information, such as status.

## When not to use

- If there's an interaction (such as add/remove)---use a [tag](/components/interaction/tag/).
- If the entire message has an associated action---use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
- For a circled badge for notifications---use a [notification badge](/components/information/notificationbadge/)

**2. Label** (Works best when short)

## Behavior

### Display static info

Badges are indicators of static information.
They can be updated when a status changes,
but they should **not** be actionable.

When you have extra information to display,
it's possible to include a simple interaction,
such as displaying a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/) on hover.
When doing so, make sure it's clear that the interaction is there.

### Support with icons

With such small space to convey a message,
visual cues can help users understand the idea more quickly.
Use icons to display more information in a smaller size,
such as what form of transport is included.

The badge can be only an icon. Just be sure to keep it [accessible](/foundation/accessibility/)
by giving it a label for people who don't see the icon.

<Guideline type="do" title="Use icons only on left" />

Use icons on the right **only** when that icon relates to
there being further explanation of the label (such as to signal there's a tooltip).

<ReactExample exampleId="Badge-icon" />

## Content

### Keep it short

Badges are small and can't contain much information.
They're great for indicating status or how much of something is selected.
But you can't fit a lot into that space.

If you have more information to display,
use another component.
To keep the UI uncluttered, you can choose one that supports [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/),
such as a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/).
This can wrap text or even a badge.

## Look & feel

### Badge types

There are six basic types of badges. All except white badges have an inverted variant for use with different backgrounds.

<ReactExample exampleId="Badge-types" />

#### Neutral badges

Neutral badges present information without adding any emotion.
They're useful when the information isn't so important to the user's main flow.

#### White badges

White badges are useful when presenting neutral information within a dark context.

#### Info badges

Informational badges help to highlight some information as particularly important.
They draw attention to the badge without stating whether it was positive or a potential problem.

#### Success badges

Success badges help to highlight something desirable has happened or will happen.
You can use them in situations like a confirmation of a user action (such as booking a trip)
or potentially attractive options (such as free baggage).

#### Warning badges

Warning badges highlight information that might have a negative impact on the user
but isn't critical.
They're associated with negative emotions
so only use them occasionally to stop potential problems before they happen.

#### Critical badges

Critical badges call attention to problems that require immediate attention from the user.
These badges create feelings of stress so only use them for issues where they're truly necessary.
