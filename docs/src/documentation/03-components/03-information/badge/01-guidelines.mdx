<ReactExample name="Badge" />

## When to use

- To call attention to details in a way that makes it easy to scan.
- To present information, such as status.

### When not to use

- If there's an interaction (such as add/remove)---use a [tag](/components/interaction/tag/).
- If the entire message has an associated action---use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
- For a circled badge for notifications--- use a [notification badge](/components/information/notificationbadge/)

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Badge" />

/>

## Behavior

### Display static info

Badges are indicators of static information.
They can be updated when a status changes,
but they should **not** be actionable.

When you have extra information to display,
it's possible to include a simple interaction,
such as displaying a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/) on hover.
When doing so, make sure it's clear that the interaction is there.

<Guidelines type="do" title="Don't combine with text link">

If you'd like to have an action, consider an [alert](/components/information/alert/) or a [button](/components/action/button/) instead.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="25%3A40"
  alt="An alert with the message 'Your booking failed' and a button labelled 'Get details'."
/>
<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="25%3A40"
  alt="A badge with the text: Booking failed. Get details. The second sentence is a link."
/>

</Guidelines>

### Support with icons

With such small space to convey a message,
visual cues can help users understand the idea more quickly.
Use icons to display more information in a smaller size,
such as what form of transport is included.

The badge can be only an icon. Just be sure to keep it [accessible](/foundation/accessibility/)
by giving it a label for people who don't see the icon.

<Guidelines type="do" title="Use icons only on left">

Icons connected to the badge meaning should be displayed on the left.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="32%3A13"
  alt="A badge with an icon of passengers on the left of the number 4."
/>
<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="32%3A7"
  alt="A badge with the number 4 and to the right an icon of passengers."
/>

</Guidelines>

Use icons on the right **only** when that icon relates to
there being further explanation of the label (such as to signal there's a tooltip).

<ReactExample name="Badge icon" />

## Content

### Keep it short

Badges are small and can't contain much information.
They're great for indicating status or how much of something is selected.
But you can't fit a lot into that space.

If you have more information to display,
use another component.
To keep the UI uncluttered, you can choose one that supports [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/),
such as a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/).
This can wrap text or even a badge.

<Guidelines type="do" title="Keep badges short">

Use progressive disclosure for other information.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="29%3A574"
  alt="A badge with an icon of passengers and the number 4 and a tooltip saying 2 adults and 2 children."
/>

## Look & feel

### Badge types

There are six basic types of badges. All except white badges have an inverted variant for use with different backgrounds.

#### Neutral badges

Neutral badges present information without adding any emotion.
They're useful when the information isn't so important to the user's main flow.

<ReactExample name="Badge neutral" />

#### White badges

White badges are useful when presenting neutral information within a dark context.

<ReactExample name="Badge white" />

#### Info badges

Informational badges help to highlight some information as particularly important.
They draw attention to the badge without stating whether it was positive or a potential problem.

<ReactExample name="Badge info" />

#### Success badges

Success badges help to highlight something desirable has happened or will happen.
You can use them in situations like a confirmation of a user action (such as booking a trip)
or potentially attractive options (such as free baggage).

<ReactExample name="Badge success" />

#### Warning badges

Warning badges highlight information that might have a negative impact on the user
but isn't critical.
They're associated with negative emotions
so only use them occasionally to stop potential problems before they happen.

<ReactExample name="Badge warning" />

#### Critical badges

Critical badges call attention to problems that require immediate attention from the user.
These badges create feelings of stress so only use them for issues where they're truly necessary.

<ReactExample name="Badge critical" />
