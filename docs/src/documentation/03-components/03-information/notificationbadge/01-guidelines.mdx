<ReactExample name="NotificationBadge" />

## When to use

- To show how many notifications a user has.
- To show simple information that doesn't require interaction (such as the type of transport).

### When not to use

- For anything longer than a very short number or one icon---use a [badge](/components/information/badge/).
- To include an action---use a [button](/components/action/button/)
  (a circled button has a similar look with an action).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="NotificationBadge" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="119%3A1159"
  alt="Type: visually supports the message with different styles for different types; icon: optionally represent the notification visually and is not an action; content: displays the number of the notification and will not display if an icon is used."
/>

## Behavior

### Prefer inverted critical for notifications

Generally, notification badges are used to draw attention to something to be done.
They're not an action themselves, so we avoid [interactive](/foundation/color/#interactive-colors)
and [actionable](/foundation/color/#actionable-colors) colors.
It's best to use inverted critical badges unless you have a specific reason not to.

## Content

### Limit content

Notification badges are very small and circular.
This means they can't hold much content.
Use only an icon or a number no more than 2 digits.

### Include nonvisual info

When you're using only an icon for the notification badge,
make sure to include the same information nonvisually
so even people who won't see the icon [get the same message](/foundation/accessibility/).

## Look & feel

### NotificationBadge types 

There are six basic types of badges.
Info and critical badges have an inverted variant for use with different backgrounds.
You should [default to using inverted critical badges](#prefer-inverted-critical-for-notifications).
