import MoreThanColorSnippet from "snippets/more-than-color.mdx";

<ReactExample exampleId="" />

## When to use

- To display temporary short messages.
- To react to user input (let users know something is happening).

### When not to use

- If the message should stay on the screen---use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
- When you want to include an action---use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
- When an action is necessary before continuing---use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/)
  or [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Toast" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA" node="" alt="" />

## Behavior

### Use for non-critical messages

Toasts usually disappear on their own.
So any critical messages or errors that would block a user's flow don't get enough attention.

For errors and other critical messages,
place the message in the screen itself.
If the message is important but doesn't block the flow,
use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
If the user should be blocked,
use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/) or [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog/).

### Not actionable

Toasts are built for messages only, not actions.
They can include links to additional information,
but nothing that would be required.
Toasts can disappear, meaning the actions would too.

Make the actions available directly on the screen.
If there are actions associated with the message,
use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
Otherwise, use [buttons and other action components](/guides/using-button-type-components/).

## Content

### Keep it short

Toasts only appear temporarily,
so there's no time for long messages.
Limit yourself to no more than 1 line.
Aim for shorter if possible.

If more information is necessary,
use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/)
to a more detailed description (don't truncate the toast itself).

## Look & feel

### Toast types

#### Success

Success toasts confirm that a user's action was processed.
Use them to show success when the screen doesn't change.

#### Warning

Warning toasts warn the user about situations that might be unfavorable.
Use them for general travel warnings.
Don't use them for any critical information that should break the user's flow.

#### Informational

Informational toasts present general content
without an associated positive (success) or negative (warning) emotion.

### Positioning

This component can be in different positions that are commonly used on websites,
such as a corner of the screen.
For mobile devices, the component is located at the top of the screen
and is stretched to cover the entire screen width.
