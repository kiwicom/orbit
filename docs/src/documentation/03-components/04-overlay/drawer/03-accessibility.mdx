# Accessibility

## Drawer

The Drawer component has been designed with accessibility in mind. It follows best practices for modal dialogs and sliding panels, ensuring a good experience for users of assistive technologies.

### Focus Management

The Drawer implements partial focus management:

1. When opened, focus is automatically moved to the first focusable element inside the drawer
2. While open, focus is trapped within the drawer (users can't focus elements outside)

#### Implementing Focus Return

The Drawer does not automatically return focus to the trigger element when closed. To ensure a proper accessible experience, you should implement this behavior in your application:

```jsx
const triggerRef = React.useRef(null);
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);

const handleClose = () => {
  setIsOpen(false);
  // Ensure focus returns to the trigger element
  setTimeout(() => {
    triggerRef.current?.focus();
  }, 0);
};

return (
  <>
    <Button ref={triggerRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)} aria-expanded={isOpen}>
      Open Drawer
    </Button>
    <Drawer shown={isOpen} onClose={handleClose}>
      Content
    </Drawer>
  </>
);
```

### ARIA Attributes

The component supports several accessibility-enhancing props:

| Name      | Type     | Description                                                                               |
| :-------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ariaLabel | `string` | Provides an accessible name for the drawer when a visible title isn't present             |
| labelHide | `string` | Sets the accessible label for the close button. This should be translated and descriptive |

### Toggle Element

The element that toggles the drawer (usually a button) should use `aria-expanded` to indicate the drawer's state. This needs to be implemented on your trigger element:

```jsx
<Button
  onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
  aria-expanded={isOpen} // You must add this attribute to your trigger
>
  Toggle Drawer
</Button>
```

### Keyboard Interaction

The Drawer supports standard keyboard interactions:

- `Escape` key closes the drawer
- `Tab` cycles through focusable elements within the drawer
- `Shift + Tab` cycles backwards through focusable elements

### Screen Reader Considerations

1. Use meaningful and translated strings for:

- The drawer's title or `ariaLabel`
- The close button's `labelHide`
- Any action buttons within the drawer

2. When the drawer contains sections or important content, consider using proper heading hierarchy

```jsx
<Drawer
  shown={isOpen}
  onClose={handleClose}
  labelHide="Close navigation menu" // Translated, descriptive label
  ariaLabel="Main navigation" // When no visible title is present
>
  <Heading type="title2">Navigation</Heading>
  <Stack>{/* drawer content */}</Stack>
</Drawer>
```

### Best Practices

1. Always provide a clear and accessible way to close the drawer:

- Through the close button (with proper `labelHide`)
- By pressing the Escape key
- By clicking outside the drawer

2. Ensure sufficient color contrast for all content within the drawer

3. If the drawer contains a form or interactive elements, ensure they are properly labeled and have appropriate ARIA attributes

4. Consider the drawer's content structure and ensure it follows a logical reading order for screen readers

5. **Important**: Implement focus return behavior in your application to ensure the trigger element regains focus when the drawer is closed

6. **Important**: Add `aria-expanded` to your trigger element to indicate the drawer's state to assistive technologies
