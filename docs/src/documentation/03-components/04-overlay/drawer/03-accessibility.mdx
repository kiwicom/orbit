## Accessibility

## Drawer

The Drawer component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

To ease keyboard navigation, when opening a drawer, the focus is moved to the drawer.

It should not be possible to focus anything outside of the drawer while it is open, ensuring a focused user experience.

When closing the drawer, **the focus should be moved back to the element that triggered the drawer**.
This is not handled automatically, so make sure to implement this behavior in your application by managing focus properly.

### Keyboard interaction

The Drawer component handles the following keyboard interactions:

- **Escape** key closes the drawer
- **Tab** key cycles through focusable elements within the drawer
- **Shift+Tab** navigates backward through focusable elements

### ARIA attributes

The Drawer component accepts ARIA attributes to ensure it's accessible to users of assistive technologies. You can provide these attributes as described below:

| Name      | Type     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ariaLabel | `string` | Text that labels the drawer content. Think of it as the title of the drawer. This should be used if `title` is not defined. |

If you provide a `title` prop, it is automatically used as the drawer's `aria-label`.
However, if you also provide a `ariaLabel` prop, it will take precedence over the `title` prop.

### Close button

The Drawer component includes a close button that can be displayed in the header. It's important to use the `labelHide` prop to provide an accessible label for this button.

The default value is "Hide", but you should consider providing a more descriptive label, especially for internationalization purposes.

### Toggle element

When implementing a toggle element to open and close the drawer, it's essential that the element uses the `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate whether the drawer is open (`true`) or closed (`false`).
This informs assistive technologies about the current state of the drawer.

Additionally, the toggle element should use the `aria-controls` attribute with the value matching the drawer's ID.
This creates a programmatic association between the toggle and the drawer it controls, helping assistive technologies understand this relationship.
