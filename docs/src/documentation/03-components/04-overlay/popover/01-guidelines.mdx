## When to use

- To keep small bits content off of the initial screen but still only a tap away.
- For short content or interactions that aren't necessary to the main flow.
- For content that still might interest users and can be revealed through [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/).
- To add interactions or choices in the context of the current screen.

### When not to use

- For large and/or structured content---use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/).
- To interrupt the main flow---use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/) or [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog/).
- For one choice less related to current screen---use a [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog/).
- For static, short information---use a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/).
- To add hidden information to the screen itself---use a [collapse](/components/interaction/collapse/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Popover" />

## Content structure

![Button: most common trigger to open popover, though other ways are possible; popover: wraps content and actions and can have a preferred position and alignment and/or overlap the button; content: wraps the main message or options; action area: optionally creates an area for actions associated with the whole popover, at least one of which should close the popover.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:143%3A0)

## Behavior

### Make trigger clear

Since popovers necessarily hide information from the initial screen,
users need to know how they can get to that information.

A common way to do this is a button with a chevron down icon on the right.
This makes it clear that more information can pop down below the button.

### Minimize actions

Popovers have limited space outside the main flow.
This means they're best for resolving single issues,
not many things at once.

<Guideline type="do" title="Focus actions">

![A popover with the ability to add adult and child passengers and a single primary action.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:40%3A976)

![A popover with buttons to add passenger, add special meals, and add cabin bags.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:40%3A852)

</Guideline>

## Content

### Keep it simple

Popovers present extra information or choices in a limited space.
Don't overwhelm your users with information.
