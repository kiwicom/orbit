## Accessibility

Popover is a component that displays content in an overlay when its trigger element is activated. Ensuring it's accessible is essential for users of assistive technology.

### Accessibility-related props

| Name           | Type                                                  | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ariaLabel      | `string`                                              |            | Provides an accessible name for the popover content through the `aria-label` attribute. Use this when there isn't visible text that can serve as a label.                                              |
| ariaLabelledby | `string`                                              |            | References the ID of an element that labels the popover content via the `aria-labelledby` attribute. Preferred over `ariaLabel` when visible text exists that can label the popover.                   |
| role           | `"dialog" \| "menu" \| "grid" \| "listbox" \| "tree"` | `"dialog"` | Defines the semantic role of the popover for screen readers. Choose based on the content typeâ€”for example, use `"menu"` when presenting a list of actions, or `"dialog"` for forms or complex content. |
| labelClose     | `React.Node`                                          | `"Close"`  | Label text for the close button on mobile devices, important for screen reader users to understand the button's purpose.                                                                               |

### Automatic ARIA attributes

The Popover component automatically manages several ARIA attributes on the trigger element:

- `aria-controls`: References the popover content's ID, establishing the relationship between trigger and content
- `aria-haspopup`: Indicates that activating the trigger will display a popover
- `aria-expanded`: Dynamically updates to reflect whether the popover is open or closed

These attributes are handled internally by the component, so you don't need to add them manually.

### Trigger element accessibility

The trigger element for Popover must not be an interactive element itself. This is because:

1. It avoids nesting interactive elements (an accessibility violation)
2. It prevents conflicts in keyboard navigation and focus management

```jsx
// CORRECT: Using a non-interactive component as trigger
<Popover content="Your content">
  <Button asComponent="div">Open Popover</Button>
</Popover>

// INCORRECT: Using an interactive element directly
<Popover content="Your content">
  <Button>Open Popover</Button> {/* This creates nested interactive elements */}
</Popover>
```

### Keyboard navigation

Popover supports keyboard accessibility:

- The trigger can be focused and activated with Enter or Space
- When open, pressing Escape closes the popover
- Focus remains trapped within the popover on mobile to ensure keyboard users can navigate content

### Screen reader experience

When a screen reader user encounters a Popover:

1. They'll hear the trigger announced with its role and expanded state
2. When opened, the popover content is announced according to its role (e.g., "dialog", "menu")
3. The content is identified by its accessible name (via `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledby`)

```jsx
<Popover
  content={<Stack>Your popover content here</Stack>}
  ariaLabel="Additional information"
  role="dialog"
>
  <TextLink asComponent="div">More information</TextLink>
</Popover>
```

A screen reader would announce: "More information, button, has popup dialog" when focusing the trigger, and "Additional information, dialog" when the popover opens.

### Role selection guidelines

Choose the appropriate `role` based on your popover's content:

- `dialog`: For general content, forms, or complex information (default)
- `menu`: For a list of actions or commands
- `listbox`: For a list of options where one or more can be selected
- `grid`: For tabular data arranged in rows and columns
- `tree`: For hierarchical data with parent-child relationships

Using the correct role ensures screen reader users understand the purpose and structure of the popover content.
