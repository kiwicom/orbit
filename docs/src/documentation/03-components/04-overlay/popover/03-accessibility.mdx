## Accessibility

The Popover component has been designed with accessibility in mind, providing features that enhance the experience for users of assistive technologies.

### Accessibility props

The following props are available to improve the accessibility of your Popover component:

| Prop           | Type                                                  | Default    | Description                                                                           |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ariaLabel      | `string`                                              |            | Adds `aria-label` to the popover content, providing a description for screen readers. |
| ariaLabelledby | `string`                                              |            | References the ID of an element that labels the popover content for screen readers.   |
| role           | `"dialog" \| "menu" \| "grid" \| "listbox" \| "tree"` | `"dialog"` | Defines the ARIA role of the popover component.                                       |
| labelClose     | `React.Node`                                          | `"Close"`  | The label for the close button displayed on mobile devices.                           |

### Automatic Accessibility Features

The Popover component automatically handles several important ARIA attributes on the trigger element:

- `aria-controls`: Links the trigger element to the popover content using a unique ID or `id` provided via props.
- `aria-haspopup`: Indicates that the trigger reveals additional content (set to the popover's role).
- `aria-expanded`: Indicates whether the popover is currently visible or hidden.

These attributes are managed by the component and do not need to be manually added to your code.

### Best practices

#### Non-interactive trigger elements

The Popover's trigger element (provided as `children`) should not be an interactive element like a native `<button>` or `<a>` tag, as this creates nested interactive elements which is an accessibility violation.

For example, if using a Button component as a trigger, set `asComponent="div"` to avoid this issue:

```jsx
<Popover content="Popover content">
  <Button asComponent="div">Open popover</Button>
</Popover>
```

#### Descriptive labels

- Provide meaningful `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledby` props to help screen reader users understand the purpose of the popover.
- The `ariaLabel` should be concise but descriptive, such as "Passenger selection" or "Filter options".
- When using `ariaLabelledby`, ensure the referenced element (by ID) contains clear, descriptive text that explains the popover's purpose.
- Always ensure that `ariaLabel` text and any text in elements referenced by `ariaLabelledby` are properly translated to match the user's language.

For example:

```jsx
// Using ariaLabel
<Popover ariaLabel="Passenger selection options" content={passengerSelectionContent}>
  <Button asComponent="div">Select passengers</Button>
</Popover>
```

```jsx
// Using ariaLabelledby
<div>
  <h2 id="passenger-selection-heading">Passenger selection</h2>
  <Popover ariaLabelledby="passenger-selection-heading" content={passengerSelectionContent}>
    <Button asComponent="div">Select passengers</Button>
  </Popover>
</div>
```

The `ariaLabel` and `ariaLabelledby` props provide important context about the popover's content to screen reader users. Always use one of these props to ensure your Popover is accessible.

#### Custom close label

When the popover is closable on mobile devices, the default "Close" label can be overridden with a more descriptive one using the `labelClose` prop.

```jsx
<Popover content="Popover content" labelClose="Close passenger selection">
  <Button asComponent="div">Select passengers</Button>
</Popover>
```

#### Keyboard navigation

The Popover component supports keyboard navigation:

- The popover can be opened by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> when the trigger element has focus.
- When open, the popover can be closed by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
- Focus is properly managed within the popover when it's open.

#### Appropriate roles

The `role` prop should be chosen based on the popover's content and purpose:

- Use `"dialog"` (the default) for most cases, especially when presenting forms or information.
- Use `"menu"` when the popover contains a list of actions or menu items.
- Use `"listbox"` when presenting a list of selectable options.
- Use `"grid"` for tabular data.
- Use `"tree"` for hierarchical, expandable/collapsible content.

### Examples

#### Basic popover with proper labeling

```jsx
<Popover
  content={<Text>This is additional information about this feature.</Text>}
  ariaLabel="Feature information"
>
  <Button asComponent="div">More info</Button>
</Popover>
```

Screen readers would announce: "More info, dialogue pop-up collapsed, button" and when opened: "Feature information, dialog".

#### Popover with custom role and existing label

```jsx
<Stack>
  <h2 id="passenger-selection">Passenger selection</h2>
  <Popover
    content={
      <Stack>
        <Stepper
          minValue={0}
          ariaLabelValue="Number of adult passengers"
          titleIncrement="Add adult passenger"
          titleDecrement="Remove adult passenger"
        />
      </Stack>
    }
    role="menu"
    ariaLabelledby="passenger-selection"
  >
    <Button asComponent="div" iconRight={<ChevronDown />}>
      Select passengers
    </Button>
  </Popover>
</Stack>
```

In this example, screen readers would announce "Select passengers, menu pop-up collapsed, button" and when opened: "Passenger selection, menu".
