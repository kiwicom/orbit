<ReactExample exampleId="ChoiceGroup-default" />

## When to use

- To group choices together under a single heading.
- To offer unified instructions for a group
  where users can either select one (with [radios](/components/input/radio/))
  or multiple (with [checkboxes](/components/input/checkbox/) options.

### When not to use

- To present more than just a few options---use a [select](/components/input/select/)

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="ChoiceGroup" />

## Content structure

![Label: presents a clear opening statement to help users pick; choices: choices to pick from -- usually Radio or Checkbox, depending on if users should pick one or more options; error message: helps users through the problem to a solution.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:0%3A216)

## Behavior

### Use for closely related options

Choice groups override the settings of individual choices to present a coherent whole.
This means they're great for a few choices that make a single unit.

They're not good at grouping many options,
such as all countries in the world.
For many options, consider using a [select](/components/input/select/).

## Content

### Use labels properly

Labels serve to clearly present what the choice means for users.
They're especially important for [people who don't see other visual cues](/foundation/accessibility/).
But they also help everyone know exactly what to choose.

Follow the labeling advice for [radios](/components/input/radio/#use-parallel-labels)
or [checkboxes](/components/input/checkbox/#write-positive-labels).
In particular, make sure all the labels have a parallel structure.

### Use helpful error messages

With more complicated choices,
sometimes labels aren't enough
or sometimes the option the user wants isn't available.
Use clear, calm error messages when there's a problem with a choice.

Remember that such messages are likely to invoke negative feelings,
so be positive and focused on solutions to any problems.

Only messages you include for the choice group appear.
Any messages for individual choices within the group aren't shown.
