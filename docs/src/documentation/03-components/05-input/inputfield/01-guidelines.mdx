## When to use

- To gather basic information from users.
- To specify what kind of data users can enter.

### When not to use

- You have multiple related fields---use an [input group](/components/input/inputgroup/).
- You want longer responses from users (such as feedback)---use a [textarea](/components/input/textarea/).
- You want users to upload a file---use an [input file](/components/input/inputfile/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="InputField" />

### Mobile

![Label: provides a clear description of what users should fill in; placeholder: provides additional help for expected values; prefix: optionally adds icon or text context for expected values.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:289%3A17)

### Desktop

![Label: provides a clear description of what users should fill in; placeholder: provides additional help for expected values; prefix: optionally adds icon or text context for expected values; suffix: optionally improves clarity (text adds context and ButtonLink is actionable).](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:576%3A1259)

## Behavior

### Set input mode

Setting the proper input mode for the field (such as number, email address)
helps make it clear what's expected.
It also displays the correct keyboard on mobile devices,
making it easier for users to complete the field.

## Look & feel

### Background color and borders

It's important for fields to stand out from the background
as something different that can be filled in.

That's why our native fields come with a <InlineToken name="paletteCloudNormal" alternateName /> background
to stand out against the <InlineToken name="paletteWhite" alternateName /> background natural to the app.
And they don't have a border as that would make them too heavy and overwhelming.

For our desktop and responsive fields,
which are usually placed against a <InlineToken name="paletteCloudLight" alternateName /> background,
the fields have a <InlineToken name="paletteWhite" alternateName /> background to stand out.
They get a solid 1 px border to make sure it's clear they're a place to add input.

### Suffixes

On mobile devices, users are used to the pattern
where the right side of the input allows them to clear what they've entered.
So that's the only option for suffixes for native inputs.

On desktops, there isn't such a common pattern,
so there's more freedom for input suffixes.
Use icons or text to add clarity
and [button links](/components/action/buttonlink/) to add actions
(such as opening more information).
