### Accessibility

- For special cases you can use your own, detached `label`. Simply like this:

```jsx
<label for="NICEID">Content</label>
<InputField
  id="NICEID"
/>
```

- The `ariaLabel` prop allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute for the InputField component. This attribute provides additional information to screen readers, enhancing the accessibility of the component. By using `ariaLabel`, you can ensure that users who rely on assistive technologies receive the necessary context and information about the component's purpose and functionality.
- If the `label` prop is not provided, the `ariaLabel` prop must be specified to ensure component accessibility.
