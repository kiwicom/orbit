### Accessibility

- For special cases you can use your own, detached `label`. Simply like this:

```jsx
<label for="NICEID">Content</label>
<InputField
  id="NICEID"
/>
```

- The `ariaLabel` prop allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute for the InputField component. This attribute provides additional information to screen readers, enhancing the accessibility of the component. By using `ariaLabel`, you can ensure that users who rely on assistive technologies receive the necessary context and information about the component's purpose and functionality.

- If the `label` prop is not provided, the `ariaLabel` prop must be specified to ensure component accessibility.

- The `ariaDescribedby` prop allows you to specify an `aria-describedby` attribute for the InputField component. This attribute links the component to additional descriptive text, enhancing accessibility by providing supplementary information to screen readers.

```jsx
  <InputField label="Password" type="password" ariaDescribedby="password-requirements" />
  <p id="password-requirements" style={{ display: "none", visibility: "hidden" }}>
    Password must be at least 8 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter and one number.
  </p>
```

When using the `error` or `help` props, the component automatically manages the `aria-describedby` attribute:

```jsx
<InputField label="Username" error="This username is already taken" />
```

In this example, the error message is automatically associated with the input field via `aria-describedby`.

If you provide both an `ariaDescribedby` prop and use `error` or `help`, the component automatically combines them, ensuring that screen readers announce all descriptive content:

```jsx
  <p id="email-hint" style={{ display: "none", visibility: "hidden" }}>
    We'll never share your email with anyone else.
  </p>
  <InputField label="Email" error="Invalid email format" ariaDescribedby="email-hint" />
```

In this example, both the "email-hint" text and the error message will be announced by screen readers. The text from `ariaDescribedby` will be announced first, followed by the text from `error`.

### InputGroup Integration

When using InputField within an InputGroup, the `aria-describedby` association follows these rules:

#### Example 1

If the InputGroup has `error`/`help` messages, these will be properly associated with all child components:

```jsx
<InputGroup label="Passenger details" error="Incomplete information">
  <InputField label="First name" />
  <InputField label="Last name" />
</InputGroup>
```

In this example, all InputField components will have the InputGroup's error message "Incomplete information" announced by screen readers.

#### Example 2

If individual InputField components have their own `error`/`help` messages (and the InputGroup doesn't), only those specific components will have `aria-describedby` set:

```jsx
<InputGroup label="Passenger details">
  <InputField label="First name" />
  <InputField label="Last name" error="Last name is required" />
</InputGroup>
```

In this example, only the second InputField will have its error message "Last name is required" announced.

#### Example 3

Avoid setting `ariaDescribedby` directly on InputField components when inside an InputGroup, as these values will be overwritten by the InputGroup's internal accessibility logic:

```jsx
<InputGroup label="Contact information">
  <Select options={countryOptions} label="Country" />
  <InputField
    label="Phone number"
    ariaDescribedby="phone-hint" // This will be overwritten
  />
  <p id="phone-hint" style={{ display: "none", visibility: "hidden" }}>
    Enter your phone number
  </p>
</InputGroup>
```

In this example, the `ariaDescribedby` value "phone-hint" will be ignored because the InputGroup manages the accessibility associations internally. Instead, rely on the InputGroup's `error`/`help` props or the component's own `error`/`help` props.
