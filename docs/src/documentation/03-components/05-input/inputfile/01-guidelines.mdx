<ReactExample exampleId="InputFile" />

## When to use

- To collect files from users.
- To provide clear guidance on what should be attached.

### When not to use

- To collect small pieces of information---use an [input field](/components/input/inputfield/).
- To collect longer, text responses from users---use a [text area](/components/input/textarea/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="InputFile" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="44%3A1017"
  alt="Label: provides a clear description of what users should upload; placeholder: provides additional info before a file is uploaded; button label: describes the main action and works best when short; help: optionally provides additional help for what's expected."
/>

## Content

<InputLabelsSnippet />

### Use specific action text

In addition to a label to help direct user action,
change the label on the upload button to make it specific to what users need to upload.

<ReactExample exampleId="InputFile button label" />

<InputHelpErrorSnippet />

#### Help message

<ReactExample exampleId="InputFile help" />

#### Error message

<ReactExample exampleId="InputFile error" />

### Consider including placeholder text

To prompt users to upload a file,
consider including relevant placeholder text to indicate the task isn't done yet.

Remember that placeholder text is visually less important, low in contrast,
and disappears once users enter anything.
So do **not** include anything **necessary**, such as what file types are allowed.
