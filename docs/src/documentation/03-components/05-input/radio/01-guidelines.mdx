### Show multiple options, but not too many

Radios force users to choose only one option.
Make sure they're always presented with two or more options.
If you have many options to choose from,
consider using a [select](/components/input/select/)
to decrease the initial cognitive load on users.

## Content

### Use parallel labels

Whether you're offering filters for transport options,
statuses for requests, or types of special meals,
always present options using the same structure.
