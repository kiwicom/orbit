## When to use

- To present a few options where only one can be selected.

### When not to use

- When you have many options---use a [select](/components/input/select/).
- When multiple options can be selected---use a [checkbox](/components/input/checkbox/).
- For single on/off settings with an instant response---use a [switch](/components/interaction/switch/).
- You want to group multiple options together into a single basic choice---use a [choice group](/components/input/choicegroup/).

### Show multiple options, but not too many

Radios force users to choose only one option.
Make sure they're always presented with two or more options.
If you have many options to choose from,
consider using a [select](/components/input/select/)
to decrease the initial cognitive load on users.

## Content

### Use parallel labels

Whether you're offering filters for transport options,
statuses for requests, or types of special meals,
always present options using the same structure.
