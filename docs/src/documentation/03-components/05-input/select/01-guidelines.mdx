## When to use

- To present many options where only one can be selected.
- To keep long lists of options from being overwhelming.
- To fit multiple options into a small space.

## When not to use

- When you have only a few options and enough space---use a [radio](/components/input/radio/).
- When users can select more than one of a few options---use a [checkbox](/components/input/checkbox/).
- When users can add and remove from many options---consider an [input field](/components/input//inputfield/)
  with [tags](/components/interaction/tag/).
- For structured options with enough space---use a [list choice](/components/input/listchoice/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Select" />

## Content structure

![Label: provides a clear description of what users should fill in; placeholder: provides additional help for expected values; prefix: optionally adds additional clarity for options; select suffix: indicates there are options to choose from.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:171%3A1252)

## Behavior

### Use for many options

Selects work well to present many different options in a compact unit.
This way users don't have to scroll through tens of options to find what they're looking for.

When you have only a few options so users aren't overwhelmed by them,
it can help to present them all at once,
such as with [radio buttons](/components/input/radio/).
