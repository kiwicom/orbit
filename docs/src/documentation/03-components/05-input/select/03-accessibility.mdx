## Accessibility

The Select component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

It supports keyboard navigation and includes the following properties that provide additional information to screen readers:

| Name           | Type     | Description                                                            |
| :------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ariaLabel      | `string` | Allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute of the component.      |
| ariaLabelledby | `string` | Allows you to specify an `aria-labelledby` attribute of the component. |

While these props are optional, we recommend including them to ensure proper accessibility of the component, especially if the `label` prop is not provided.

These attributes help users better understand the component's purpose and context, improving the overall experience with assistive technologies.

### Examples

The following code snippets show different ways to use these properties:

```jsx
<Select options={options} value={categoryValue} onChange={onChange} label="Category" />
```

```jsx
<Select
  options={options}
  value={categoryValue}
  onChange={onChange}
  ariaLabel="Select passenger category"
/>
```

```jsx
<Stack>
  <p id="passengers-category-label" style={{ display: "none", visibility: "hidden" }}>
    Select passenger category
  </p>

  <Select
    options={options}
    value={categoryValue}
    onChange={onChange}
    ariaLabelledby="passengers-category-label"
  />
</Stack>
```

Using the `ariaLabel` prop enables screen readers to properly announce the Select component if the `label` prop is not provided.

Alternatively, you can use the `ariaLabelledby` prop to reference another element that serves as a label for the Select component. The `ariaLabelledby` prop can reference multiple ids, separated by a space. The elements with those ids can be hidden, so that their text is only announced by screen readers.

Note that if both `ariaLabel` and `ariaLabelledby` props are provided, `ariaLabelledby` takes precedence.

For better screen reader experience, you can always complement the `label` prop with `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledby`:

```jsx
<Select
  options={options}
  value={languageValue}
  onChange={onChange}
  label="Language"
  ariaLabel="Select your language"
/>
```

For enhanced accessibility, it is recommended to have these label strings translated.

When using the `help` or `error` props, their content is set as `aria-describedby` on the element. Screen readers will announce this additional information after reading the component's label (whether provided via `label`, `ariaLabel`, or `ariaLabelledby` props).

```jsx
<Select
  options={options}
  value={nationalityValue}
  onChange={onChange}
  label="Nationality"
  error="Required field"
/>
```

It would have the screen reader announce: “Nationality. Required field.”.
