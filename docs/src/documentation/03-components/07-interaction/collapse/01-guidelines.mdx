## When to use

- To keep content off the initial screen but still only a tap away.
- For details not necessary to the main flow.
- To support [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure).

### When not to use

- For structured information to show one section at a time---use an [accordion](/components/structure/accordion/).
- For information and/or actions outside the scope of the screen---use a [popover](/components/overlay/popover/).
- For explanations connected to specific elements---use a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/).
- For actions outside the main flow---use a [dialog](/components/overlay/tooltip/) (for simple choices)
  or a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/) (for more structure or options).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Collapse" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="366%3A1604"
  alt="Label: clearly indicates what can be hidden/shown; actions: optionally creates an area for actions that relate to the entire contents; collapse controller: indicates the state, which can be expanded or not."
/>

## Behavior

### Use for less essential information

Because it requires an extra interaction,
information inside a collapse isn't be seen by all users.
So it's a great container for extra information that adds context that some users might want
but no users absolutely requires.

Don't use it to hide errors or anything else that might block a user's flow.
Remember that they might not choose to open it.

## Content

### Make content clear from label

The label is the first thing all users see,
and the only thing most of them will see.
Make sure it's clear what the collapse contains
so they know whether they want to see more.

Keep the label short but clear.
Focus on nouns describing what the collapse contains.
