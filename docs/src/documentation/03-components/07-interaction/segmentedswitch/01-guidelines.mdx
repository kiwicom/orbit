<ReactExample exampleId="SegmentedSwitch-default" />

## When to use

- To enable users to switch between two views of settings or sort elements.

## When not to use

- With only one single-select segmented button.
- To present multiple options---use a [choice group](/components/input/choicegroup/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="SegmentedSwitch" />

## Behavior

Currently SegmentedSwitch allows to have 2 segments. Each segment is clearly divided and contains label text.
It's possible to have one segment as checked by default via `defaultCheck` property.
It supports `Help` and `Error` states, that could help you to provide more information to the user.
Tab navigation is similar to radio input elements, first element selected by `Tab`, switching between elements is happening by arrow keys.
