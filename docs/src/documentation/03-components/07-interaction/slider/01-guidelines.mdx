## When to use

- To offer users options within a clearly defined range.
- To offer a visually pleasing interface.
- To let users select a single value or a range of values.

  with the input mode set to number.

## Component status

## Content structure

![Label: optionally provides an overview of what's being selected; value description: optionally clearly describes the range users can select from; histogram description: optionally describes what's contained in the selected range in the histogram; histogram: optionally shows what's included in the selection; min value: sets the lowest possible value; max value: sets the highest possible value; handlers: enable users to select their desired value and to improve accessibility it's best to add a label.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:177%3A0)

## Behavior

### Present immediate feedback

Users are used to seeing immediate results from interacting with sliders,
such as from volume controls on phones and video players.
Make sure they can see the effect of their choice of range.

Histograms help with this by offering a visualization of what's included within the range.
Just make sure the information is also included non-visually
so [everyone can access it](/foundation/accessibility/).

### Use for appropriate ranges

Sliders work well for many kinds of values.
But if the range is too large (such as 0 to 1,000 counting by 1)
or too small (such as 0 to 3),
they start to lose their benefits.

For large ranges, try to break it into smaller pieces,
or step up and down by a large number.
For small ranges,
consider [checkboxes](/components/input/checkbox/) or [selects](/components/input/select/).

### Hide on small screens

When a screen doesn't have enough space for a full slider,
hide it initially behind a button.
[Popovers](/components/overlay/popover/) are great for disclosing sliders properly.

### Make range clear

Users want to know exactly what they're selecting from.
So make it clear what the minimum and maximum of the range are.

The value description is the place to present this information clearly
without it demanding too much attention.
