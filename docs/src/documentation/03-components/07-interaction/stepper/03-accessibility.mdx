## Accessibility

The Stepper component has been designed with accessibility in mind. It can be used with keyboard navigation and includes properties that enhance the experience for users of assistive technologies.

The following props provide additional information to screen readers:

- The `ariaLabelValue` prop allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute for the input element (stepper value) in the Stepper (StepperStateless) component.

- The `titleDecrement` prop allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute for the decrement icon button in the Stepper (StepperStateless) component.

- The `titleIncrement` prop allows you to specify an `aria-label` attribute for the increment icon button in the Stepper (StepperStateless) component.

- The `ariaLabelledBy` prop allows you to specify an `aria-labelledby` attribute for the Stepper component. This attribute references the ID of the element that labels the Stepper (StepperStateless), ensuring that screen readers announce the label correctly.

Although these props are optional for the Stepper (StepperStateless) component itself, it is recommended to fill them in.

### Example

```jsx
<Stepper
  step={1}
  minValue={0}
  minValue={10}
  ariaLabelValue="Number of passengers"
  titleDecrement="Remove a passenger"
  titleIncrement="Add a passenger"
/>
```

The screen reader will announce the value title (`Number of passengers`) and buttons title (`Add a passenger`, `Remove a passenger`) once they are focused by the screen reader.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Stack>
    <Text id="passengers">Passengers</Text>
  </Stack>
  <Stepper
    step={1}
    minValue={0}
    minValue={10}
    ariaLabelValue="Number of passengers"
    ariaLabelledby="passengers"
    titleDecrement="Remove a passenger"
    titleIncrement="Add a passenger"
  />
</Stack>
```

This example includes `ariaLabelledby` prop. In this case, `ariaLabelledBy` prop is prioritized over `ariaLabelValue`, so the screen reader will announce the value title (`Passengers`) and buttons title (`Add a passenger`, `Remove a passenger`) once they are focused by the screen reader.
