## When to use

- To show travelers how many times they'll have a stop in a given [segment](/kiwi-use/content/glossary/#segment).

### When not to use

- For general visual context---use an [illustration](/components/visuals/illustration/).
- For other visual cues including other arrows---use an [icon](/components/visuals/icon/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="StopoverArrow" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="194%3A95"
  alt="Stops: represent each stop on a segment from 0 to 3."
/>

## Content

### Include nonvisual information

Stopover arrows can create important context for users,
but [not everyone will see them](/foundation/accessibility/).
So make sure everything necessary is presented in a non-visual form.

Include text that is accessible to everyone
or text that is [displayed only to screen readers](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/).
Or your other favorite technique.
Just make sure everyone gets the information somehow.
