# Accessibility

## Heading

The Heading component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node, the `role` attribute, and the `level` attribute.
These properties allow for the creation of semantic and accessible headings.

| Name  | Type                                                    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| as    | `"h1" \| "h2" \| "h3" \| "h4" \| "h5" \| "h6" \| "div"` | Defines the HTML element to be rendered.                                                                                    |
| role  | `"heading"`                                             | Can only be used if `as="div"`. If defined, sets the role of the element to be "heading".                                   |
| level | `number`                                                | Can only be used if `as="div"` and "`role="heading`". Defines the `aria-level` of the rendered `div` with the heading role. |

All the props above are optional by default.

If they are not provided, the component will render a `div` element with no role or aria-level defined.
It is not semantically wrong but won't tell screen readers that the element is a heading. This should be used only for decorative purposes.

```jsx
<Heading>Hello World!</Heading>
```

renders:

```html
<div>Hello World!</div>
```

If the `as` prop is set to `"div"` (or undefined), the `role` prop is optional, but only accepts one possible value (if not `undefined`): `"heading"`.
If the `role` prop is set to `"heading"`, the `level` prop must be defined as well. It will tell assistive technologies the level of the heading.
The `level` prop must be a number between 1 and 6 and cannot be used if the `role` prop is not set to `"heading"`.

```jsx
<Heading as="div" role="heading" level={1}>
  Hello World!
</Heading>
```

renders:

```html
<div role="heading" aria-level="1">Hello World!</div>
```

If the `as` prop is set to `"h1"`, `"h2"`, `"h3"`, `"h4"`, `"h5"`, or `"h6"`, the component will render the corresponding HTML element.
In that case, the `role` and `level` props are not needed, since assistive technologies will recognize the element as a heading and its correct level automatically.

```jsx
<Heading as="h1">Hello World!</Heading>
```

renders:

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

### Compatibility with SkipNavigation

The `dataA11ySection` prop can be used to link the Heading to a `SkipNavigation` component.
