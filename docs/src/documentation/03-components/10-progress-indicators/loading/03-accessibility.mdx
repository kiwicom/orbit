# Accessibility

## Loading

The Loading component has been designed with accessibility in mind.

The component offers flexibility in terms of the HTML element used for the root node. By default, it will render a `div` element.

### Title

Optional prop `title` allows you to specify a `title` value of the loader (svg) image. This value is announced by a screen reader. This prop should ideally be translated.

When `text` prop is filled in, then providing value for `title` prop is not needed and it could be redundant as the `text` prop will be announced by the screen reader.

### AsComponent

The prop `asComponent` is optional and it is set to a `div` by default.
This can be used when the `Loading` component is wrapped by another component which requires a [phrasing element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories) as a children.

Be aware that `Loading` component is **always** rendered as a `div` element when the prop `text` is filled in.

### Example

```jsx
<Button>
  <Loading title="Title of the button is loading" asComponent="span" />
</Button>
```

We have a `Loading` component inside a `Button` component (which requires phrasing element as a children). In this case, we can use the `asComponent` prop to specify the root node of the `Loading` component.

The screen reader will announce the value title (`Title of the button is loading`).
