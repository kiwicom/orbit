## When to use

- You have a larger process (such as processing a customer request) broken into steps.
- Users have no control over the process.
- You want set user expectations about progress being made.

### When not to use

- There is a task users should complete and you want to nudge them along the process---use a
  [wizard](/components/progress-indicators/wizard/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Timeline" />

## Content structure

![Type indicator: shows the result of completed steps; label: sets the context for the step and works best when short; sub-label: adds additional context for the step; step content: describes the step in detail.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:821%3A0)

## Look & feel

### Step types

Each completed step can have one of three results: success, warning, or critical.
Use these types to add context for the process.
