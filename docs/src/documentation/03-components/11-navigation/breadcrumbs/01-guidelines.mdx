## When to use

- To show users where they are in your overall structure.
- To offer a way to go up the hierarchy back to the start.

### When not to use

- To show steps in a process including steps in the future---use a
  [wizard](/components/progress-indicators/wizard/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Breadcrumbs" />

## Content structure

### Mobile

![Back button: allows users to easily go back one step in the path.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:536%3A1869)

### Desktop

![Back button: allows users to easily go back in the path; root item: usually the name of your product; full path: shows where the current page lies in the sitemaps; current page: shows the name of the page where the user currently is.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:542%3A251)

## Behavior

### Clearly present position

Users may come to a given screen through different flows
(such as an external link or search).
So it's important that they always know where in your structure they are.

Use breadcrumbs to show the position and that there are other screens in your hierarchy.
This helps them find related screens and navigate through your hierarchy.

### Show only parents

Breadcrumbs are useful for showing how to navigate up in a hierarchy.
They display the current screen as the final item in the list to make it clear where the user is.

There are scenarios where you might want to show children
or other screens lower in the hierarchy,
such as steps in a sign-up process.
Use a [Wizard component](/components/progress-indicators/wizard/) for these cases.

## Look & feel

### Responsive design

In large spaces like a desktop screen,
it's possible to show the entire breadcrumbs path without cluttering up the screen.

<ReactExample exampleId="Breadcrumbs-back" size="Desktop" />

When the screen gets smaller,
it becomes impossible to fit the entire path on one line.
That's why breadcrumbs on smaller screens show only **one option**:
going back to the immediate parent.

<ReactExample exampleId="Breadcrumbs-back" size="Mobile-small" />

This way users have a clear tool for navigating up in the hierarchy.
