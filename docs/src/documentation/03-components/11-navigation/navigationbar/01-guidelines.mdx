## When to use

- To offer top-level navigation and branding (such as a logo).
- To keep navigation in a consistent place throughout the app.

### When not to use

- For more complicated or lower-level navigation---use a [drawer](/components/overlay/drawer/).
- For navigation within a screen or links in an app footer--- use [tabs](/components/structure/tabs/)
- For lists of navigation links (in or out of a navigation bar)---use a [link list](/components/navigation/linklist/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="NavigationBar" />

## Content structure

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node="527%3A0"
  alt="Native bar (design first for native mobile): Back button: allows users to go back to a previous screen; title: gives users context for where they are; action: adds an action for the entire screen. Responsive bar (then make a responsive design): Home button: enables users to navigate to the top level; dropdown: optionally opens additional nav items; link list: optionally places multiple buttons next to one another; menu: optionally opens additional options."
/>

## Behavior

### Vary items by context

On large screens, it can help to have full ideas written out.
Use clear nouns to describe what each menu item means.

On smaller screens, there's not space for many words.
Use [icons](/components/visuals/icon/) to communicate the main ideas.
Just remember to include text equivalents
so [everyone knows](/foundation/accessibility/) what the items mean.

When using icons, keep them aligned to the side without large gaps in between.

<ReactExample exampleId="NavigationBar-icons" />

### Collapse menus in smaller contexts

When you have complicated navigation but only limited space,
use [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/).
Keep most items hidden at first
and offer dropdowns and [drawers](/components/overlay/drawer/) to reveal them.

Make sure users know how to open the items.
Use common patterns like a [menu icon](/foundation/icons/#menu-hamburger)
to make it clear what's possible.

<ReactExample exampleId="NavigationBar-menu" />

## Content

### Keep app bar clean

In mobile apps, the navigation bar can't hold much.
It's not the right place to hold menus or other complicated options.

If you want to add links to options in an app,
consider using a tab bar in the footer.
