## When to use

- To enable users to focus on a few items at a time.
- To make it clear there's more to explore when ready.
- For large collections of items.

### When not to use

- For only a view items---keep them all on one page.

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Pagination" />

## Content structure

![Selected page: indicates which page is currently being viewed; ellipsis: represents other pages in between to save horizontal space; page count: indicates how many pages there are in total; labels: can be hidden when needed.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:580%3A33)

## Behavior

### Use for many items

Pagination is great at breaking up large numbers of similar items into smaller groups.
You don't need to hide items behind pages when they can all fit in a single manageable view.

Generally, use pagination if you have more than 25 or so items to display.

### Ellipses

When the number of pages gets too large,
displaying them all would be overwhelming.
So if the total page count is 8 or higher,
the pages appear compactly.
Ellipses replace some pages so a reasonable number are shown.

### Disabled buttons

While we generally [recommend against using disabled buttons](/components/action/button/#avoid-disabled-buttons),
they are used in pagination on the first and last page.
If the buttons were hidden,
it would cause the other ones to jump around on the page.

With all of the other buttons next to the disabled one,
it should be clear enough to users what they need to do to enable the button.
So in this case it should work without major issues.

## Look & feel

### Responsive design

In small spaces, a list of pages would take up too much space.
So for small screens, the complete list of buttons for each page is hidden.
Instead, only the current page and total page count are show with the previous and next buttons.
