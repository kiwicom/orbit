## Accessibility

The HorizontalScroll component comes with built-in accessibility features for screen reader users through ARIA labels.

### ARIA labels

When using arrows (`arrows`), you must provide accessibility labels for both arrow buttons using the `arrowLeftAriaLabel` and `arrowRightAriaLabel` props. These labels should be properly translated strings, as they will be read by screen readers to users in their preferred language.

```jsx
<HorizontalScroll
  arrows
  arrowLeftAriaLabel="Scroll left" // Should be a translated string
  arrowRightAriaLabel="Scroll right" // Should be a translated string
>
  {/* content */}
</HorizontalScroll>
```

The labels should clearly describe the action that will occur when the button is pressed. For example:

- "See previous items"
- "Scroll to previous cards"
- "Show previous products"

Remember that these strings must be translated to provide an accessible experience for screen reader users across different languages.
