<ReactExample exampleId="Sticky-default" />

## When to use

- To keep elements present on the screen at all times.
- For actions like navigation or jumping back to the top of the page after scrolling.

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Sticky" />

## Behavior

### Use for essential actions

Sticky elements grab users' attention.
Just remember that if everything grabs for attention,
then nothing stands out as important.

Limit sticky elements to places where they add value.
This can be actions that apply to the entire page,
navigation for the entire app, or context such as headers.

## Look & feel

### Keep it small

Sticky elements take up more of the user's attention than ordinary elements.
Don't devote too much space to fixed elements.
Leave room for the rest of your designs to breathe.
