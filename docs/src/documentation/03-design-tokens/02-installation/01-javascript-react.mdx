title: Javascript or React
---

If you're already using `@kiwicom/orbit-components`,
you don't need to install the tokens because they're included as a dependency to ensure compatibility, see []()

If not, you can install the package on its own.

```shell
# Using npm
npm install --save @kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens

# Using yarn
yarn add @kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens
```

## Usage without @kiwicom/orbit-components

Once installed in your codebase, you can use our design tokens in JavaScript environment with simply importing them.

```js
import { defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens"
```

The `defaultTheme` object contains all design tokens that are available for every usage.

```js
/*
  The content of defaultTheme object
*/
{
  ...,
  fontFamily: "Roboto",
  fontSizeSmall: "12px",
  fontSizeNormal: "14px",
  fontSizeLarge: "16px",
  ...
}
```

We recommend this specified usage only for cases when you don't need to work also with `@kiwicom/orbit-components`.

## Usage with @kiwicom/orbit-components

To be able to use our design tokens together with Orbit React components, we highly recommend using import from them, instead of from design tokens.

```js
import { defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-components"
```

There is only small minor change. The `defaultTheme` contains more various data that we use for creating more advanced and scale-able user interfaces.

```js
/*
  The content of defaultTheme object
*/
{
  rtl: true,
  transitions: true,
  orbit: {
    ...,
    fontFamily: "Roboto",
    fontSizeSmall: "12px",
    fontSizeNormal: "14px",
    ...
  }
}
```

Since `@kiwicom/orbit-components` is build upon `styled-components` CSS-in-JS library, it's necessary to work with a theming (styling) context across the whole application.

To be able to use the same `theme` context object with same value across the whole application we encourage users to wrap the whole application into Orbits' `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, defaultTheme } from "@kiwicom/orbit-components";

const App = ({ children }) => {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
};
```

And, most importantly consuming the `theme` by accessing the context object directly inside `styled-components`.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

export const CustomStyled = styled.div`
  background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.orbit.paletteWhite};
`;
```

This approach enables easier consistency how to work and consume the Orbit's foundation, tokenized by `@kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens`.
Lastly, it also provides a better and easier way how to enable custom theming for your application. To read more about theming possibilities and implementation,
please check the [theming](/design-tokens/theming) page.
