## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="SocialButton" />

## Content structure

![Social service logo: shows the logo of the given sign-in service; label: nudges the user to complete the sign-in flow.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:759%3A2358)

## Behavior

### Use full width in small spaces

As with [other buttons](/components/action/button/#mobile-vs-desktop-size),
social buttons work best as full length buttons on smaller screens.

### Use only for signing in

Social buttons are designed to ease the flow for users signing in.
Don't use them in any other case or in any complex scenarios.

## Content

### Use actionable text

It should be clear from the button text exactly what happens when the user interacts with it.
To make it actionable,
the label should include the service name and the action text **_sign in_**.

Be sure to use the same text structure for all social buttons.

## Look & feel

### SocialButton services

Social buttons automatically display the logo for the selected service.
See all available services below.
