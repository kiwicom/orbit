<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-default" />

## When to use

- When you want to interrupt a user's journey with relevant information.
- For things like status messages and additional explanations.

### When not to use

- When there are already many on a page. Don't overwhelm the user.
- For messages that shouldn't interrupt the flow---consider [heading](/components/text/heading/)
  and [text](/components/text/text/).
- For temporary messages that don't draw much attention---use a [toast](/components/information/toast/).
- When no results match a user query---use an [empty state](/components/progress-indicators/emptystate/).
- When a user has to solve an issue **as soon as possible**---use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Alert" />

## Content structure

### Mobile

![Icon: supports the message; title: works best with 5 to 8 words (in English); closable: optionally lets users close the message; action: optionally adds related actions for users to take; description: provides more context for the message, usually when the message is long.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:289%3A0)

### Desktop

![Icon: supports the message; title: works best with 5 to 8 words (in English); closable: optionally lets users close the message; action: optionally adds related actions for users to take; actions: optionally adds actions for users to take; description: provides more context for the message, usually when the message is long.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:566%3A2147)

## Behavior

<MoreThanColorSnippet component="alert" />

<Guideline type="do" title="Use icons">

Without icons, people with color blindness might see success and critical alerts as the same.

![Success and critical alerts without icons are not clear without color.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:364%3A1543)

</Guideline>

### Follow up with actions

There are times when just simple information isn't enough
and the user needs to take additional steps to resolve the problem or get additional details.

In such cases, provide additional actions for your message.
Alerts use special status buttons to match the button color with the alert color.

There should be no more than two actions in each Alert:
one primary and one subtle.
See more on [the styles of the actions](/design-patterns/action-components/#alert-buttons)
and how [they should be aligned](/design-patterns/action-components/#button-alignment-in-alert).

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-actions_sidebyside" />

## Content

### Explain the alert

Explain why the user was interrupted---confirm the action that will happen
or describe what just has happened.

Keep it clear, short, and simple.
Alerts break the user flow,
so you want to explain why with as few details as possible.

For longer messages, use a title for quick info.
The user sees the title first when scanning the message.
You can also provide additional context for the alert by adding a description.
For more complex messages,
let users access more information through an action button.

<Guideline type="do" title="Provide context for your messages">

![Airline refunds apply. Message: This ticket is covered by airline refund policies. If the airline denies your application, your economy tickets will receive little or no refund.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:364%3A1687)

![Message: If the airline denies your application, your economy tickets will receive little or no refund.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:364%3A1688)

</Guideline>

## Look & feel

### Alert types

There are four types of alerts: _informational_, _success_, _warning_, and _critical_.

### Informational alert

Informational alerts are the most common alerts.
Use them to **guide a user's attention to relevant details**,
but keep it focused and related to the topic on the screen.

Consider tailoring your icons to your message.
Baggage, clocks, or other symbols strengthen the informative nature of your message.

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-info_type" />

### Success alert

Success alerts confirm that an instruction from the user,
such as to make a payment or request a refund, was processed successfully.
Usually used without an action button.

**Avoid using success alerts** when there is a follow-up action,
such as when users need to confirm something by e-mail.
For such actions, use an informational alert instead.

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-success_type" />

### Warning alert

Use warning alerts when you need to inform users about a **potentially unfavorable situation**
that requires eventual action from them.
If the issue requires immediate attention, use a critical alert.

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-warning_type" />

### Critical alert

Use critical alerts when something is **blocking** users from continuing
or an issue needs to be resolved **immediately**.
The alert should offer a solution to the problem.

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-critical_type" />

A critical alert should provide some form of solution for their problem.
If something is **important for users to solve as soon as possible**,
it's worth considering automatically opening a modal window.

### Mobile vs. desktop

The alert component's content should be the same on all platforms,
but there's more space to play with on the desktop.
That's why the desktop versions have larger fonts, icons, and inner padding.

For native or responsive views,
the design is much more compact to avoid filling the screen with the message.

<FigmaFile
  file="4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA"
  node=""
  alt="On mobile platforms, everything is more compact."
  caption="On mobile platforms, everything is more compact."
/>

![On desktop platforms, things can breathe](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:555%3A0 "On desktop platforms, things can breathe")

### Cascading visual hierarchy

![A darker title to stand out; the icon color softens the alert; a complementary description color.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:555%3A0)

Alert components have a visual hierarchy where the title is the most significant element.
The title's darker color emphasizes it against the description.
It's a minor adjustment that doesn't stand out to the user.

In React, we also force the colors of child components to match the alert type.
You can freely use [Text](/components/text/text/), [Heading](/components/text/heading/),
[List](/components/structure/list/), and [TextLink](/components/action/textlink/) components,
and the colors of these components will be automatically adjusted.
