## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Stepper" />

## Content structure

![Value: displays the current value; decrement controller: decreases the value and to improve accessibility it's best to add a title describing the action; increment controller: increases the value and to improve accessibility it's best to add a title describing the action.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:194%3A0)

## Content

### Make the value clear

A stepper by itself only presents a number.
Make sure it's clear from context what the value refers to
and what users are changing by incrementing in either direction.

You can do this with [text](/components/text/text/), [icons](/components/visuals/icon/),
or other clues nearby to show the full context of the number.
