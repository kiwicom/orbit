- With the carrier name so the context is [accessible to everyone](/foundation/accessibility/).

### When not to use

- For general visual context---use an [illustration](/components/visuals/illustration/).

## Look & Feel

### Multiple logos

Carrier logos can include up to four logos at once.
With one logo, by default it occupies the entire space.
With multiple logos, the logos are shrunk to the same size
(no matter how many more there are).

To create visual balance, the logos are positioned differently depending on their number.
With two logos, they're in the top left and bottom right.
With three, the second logo shifts to the bottom left and the third is present in the top right.
With four, the logos take up all four corners.
