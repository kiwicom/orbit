<ReactExample exampleId="PictureCard-default" />

## When to use

- To engage users with visuals and some details.
- To provide just enough information to be useful without overwhelming the visual.
- To offer actions associated with the visuals.

### When not to use

- For only simple visual context---use an [illustration](/components/visuals/illustration/).
- For card without pictures---use a [card](/components/structure/card/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="PictureCard" />

## Content structure

![Image: visually supports the message; label: optionally categorizes the card; title: optionally indicates the main focus of the card; subtitle: optionally displays additional context for the title; actions: visible on hover and optionally include actions related to the PictureCard; children: optionally includes further information and works best with static elements.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:167%3A0)

## Behavior

### Make actions clear

Users may see the interesting pictures and think they're just decoration.
If this is part of the main flow, make it clear what their next step should be.

Use cues other than just visuals to indicate why they might want to interact and what they can expect.

## Content

### Limit information

Picture cards draw attention to themselves with interesting visuals.
Don't overwhelm users by trying to cram lots of information into a small space.

Present only the most important ideas with the chance to see more with an interaction.

### Present info nonvisually

Make sure everything necessary is presented to [people who don't see the picture](/foundation/accessibility/).

If you're using the picture card as just an image,
include alternative text.
If the card has content,
consider whether the alt text is necessary
(if it repeats the title or something similar).

If the card is only for decoration,
leave the alternative text **blank**.
Providing text just gives users extra information that doesn't help them.

## Look & feel

### Use inverted colors

Picture cards have complicated backgrounds that draw attention.
That's why they darken on hover/focus---to increase the contrast with their text.

If you're adding your own content such as [badges](/components/information/badge/),
make sure to use the inverted variants so they stand out against the dark background.
