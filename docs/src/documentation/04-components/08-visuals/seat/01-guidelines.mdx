## When to use

- To show information about options for where to sit.
- To enable users to scan the distinct types to make a selection.

### When not to use

- For general visual context---use an [illustration](/components/visuals/illustration/).

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Seat" />

## Content structure

![Type: optionally adds additional information about a seat option.](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:331%3A0)

## Behavior

### Explain the types

While the visual cues available for each [seat type](#seat-types)
should help users understand their options,
some users might not understand it at first glance.
Provide a clear legend explaining each type so users can scan for what they want.

<ReactExample exampleId="Seat-legend" />

## Look & feel

### Seat sizes

Seats come in two sizes: small and medium.
Use small seats for small screens and medium seats for larger ones.
Our [media queries](/development/utilities/media-queries/)
or [useMediaQuery hook](/development/hooks/usemediaquery/)
can help with this.

### Seat types

Seat types present clear options for quick scanning.
This allows users to find the option that fits them best.
