Note that while the [typography in our Figma UI kit](https://www.figma.com/file/2rTHlBKKR6IWGeP6Dw6qbP/%5BOrbit%5D-Kiwi.com-Foundation?node-id=1%3A3)
offers three weights for bold (normal, medium, and bold),
only two of them should be used for text.
We use the medium weight for places like [badges](/components/information/badge/),
but recommend not using them for text itself.
