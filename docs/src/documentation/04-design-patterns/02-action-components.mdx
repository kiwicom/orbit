import NewWindow from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/icons/NewWindow";

Sometimes it's good to have a lot of choices.
Other times it can be overwhelming
(which is why Orbit is based around [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/)).
We have multiple options for presenting possible actions,
including [buttons](/components/action/button/),
[button links](/components/action/buttonlink/),
and [text links](/components/action/textlink/).

If you'd like some help with which component to use,
try out this interactive decision tree
You can read about the reasons for the recommendations below.

## Buttons

Our main [buttons](/components/action/button/) come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_)
and six types:

- Primary
- Primary subtle
- Secondary
- Critical
- Critical subtle
- White

### Primary buttons

Best for the [single primary action](/components/action/button/#identify-the-most-important-actions)
on the screen.
Use them when you want to continue in the flow of the app.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="96%3A1076"
  alt="A form with a primary button to 'Sign up'."
/>

### Primary subtle buttons

Also used for primary actions
but those that do **not** directly push you to continue in the flow.
They should be used when there are multiple primary actions on one page with the same importance.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="100%3A0"
  alt="Images, text, and buttons for three options: Add a meal, Rent a car, Add insurance. Each option has a primary subtle button."
/>

### Secondary buttons

Used for actions that aren't so important.
They are usually connected to primary buttons.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="101%3A0"
  alt="A modal to find accommodation, with a primary button to 'Find a room' and a secondary button to 'Close'."
/>

### Critical buttons

Used when you need to permanently delete something
or have a critical action that can't be taken back.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="101%3A52"
  alt="A dialog asking to confirm account deletion with a critical button to 'Delect account' and a secondary button to 'Cancel'."
/>

### Critical subtle buttons

Used mainly as complementary buttons to critical ones.
They're often used as a step before permanent deletion,
so they're visually less important than critical buttons.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="105%3A2047"
  alt="A screen with details on a traveler, with a critical subtle button at the button to 'Delete traveler'."
  caption="This is followed by a dialog confirming the deletion with a critical button (not a subtle one)."
/>

### White buttons

Used in settings where the background is darker than usua
and normal buttons wouldn't work,
such as a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/) or a [picture card](/components/visuals/picturecard/).

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="111%3A1400"
  alt="A dark tooltip with some text and a white button to 'Learn more'."
/>

## Alert buttons

Alert buttons should be used **only in [alerts](/components/information/alert/)**.

Each alert time has a basic button type (used in place of a primary button)
and a subtle button type (used in place of a secondary button).
There should be no more than _one basic and one subtle button_.
(See [alignment guidance below](#button-alignment-in-alert).)

## ButtonLinks

ButtonLinks come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_) and three types:

- [Primary](#primary-buttonlinks)
- [Secondary](#secondary-buttonlinks)
- [Critical](#critical-buttonlinks)

### Primary ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **primary buttons**
or as a primary standalone action that is visually less heavy than **primary subtle buttons**.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="104%3A180"
  alt="A modal with a form for places to visit, a primary button to 'Search journey', and a primary button link to 'Add destination'."
/>

### Secondary ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **secondary buttons** or as a secondary standalone action.
Often used for filters.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="104%3A36"
  alt="A search filter with a list of carriers that is incomplete and a secondary button link to 'Show all carriers'."
/>

### Critical ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **critical buttons**
or as a secondary standalone action that is visually less heavy than **critical subtle buttons**.

<FigmaFile
  file="fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa"
  node="105%3A2185"
  alt="A form to edit payment card details with a secondary button to 'Close' and a critical button link to 'Delete card'."
  caption="This can be followed by a confirmation dialog with a critical button."
/>

## TextLinks

Our main TextLinks come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_) and two types:

- Primary
- Secondary

All types can be external to show that they navigate to external pages.
With these links, the NewWindow icon (<NewWindow />) is automatically placed on the right side.

**_Primary TextLinks_** are used for primary actions inside of text (a paragraph).

**_Secondary TextLinks_** are used for secondary actions inside of text (a paragraph).

## Button alignment

**_Primary buttons_** always appear to the right.
_Secondary buttons_ appear to the left of the primary button.
Depending on the context, you can use _primary subtle buttons_ on either the left or right side.

### Button alignment in Alert

**Standalone buttons** should always be aligned to the left.
If you have **multiple buttons**, align all buttons to the left.
**Primary buttons** should be first and then **Secondary** buttons.

If the text in either of the buttons in a two-button layout is too long,
the buttons get placed on separate lines.

### Button alignment in Modal

When there is only _one action_ in Modal,
se a **primary subtle button** aligned to the left.
If there are _two actions_,
use **primary buttons** on the right of the modal action area
and **Secondary buttons** on the left.

### Button alignment in Card

The Card action area is on the right of the header
for both mobile and desktop versions.
In this area, we recommend using only a small **primary subtle button**
or a small **secondary button**.
