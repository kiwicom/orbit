Sometimes it's good to have a lot of choices.
Other times it can be overwhelming
(which is why Orbit is based around [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/)).
We have multiple options for presenting possible actions,
including [buttons](/components/action/button/),
[button links](/components/action/buttonlink/),
and [text links](/components/action/textlink/).

If you'd like some help with which component to use,
try out this interactive decision tree
You can read about the reasons for the recommendations below.

## Buttons

Our main [buttons](/components/action/button/) come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_)
and six types:

- Primary
- Primary subtle
- Secondary
- Critical
- Critical subtle
- White

### Primary buttons

Best for the [single primary action](/components/action/button/#identify-the-most-important-actions)
on the screen.
Use them when you want to continue in the flow of the app.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A form with a primary button to 'Sign up'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:96%3A1076)

</ImageContainer>

### Primary subtle buttons

Also used for primary actions
but those that do **not** directly push you to continue in the flow.
They should be used when there are multiple primary actions on one page with the same importance.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![Images, text, and buttons for three options: Add a meal, Rent a car, Add insurance. Each option has a primary subtle button.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:100%3A0)

</ImageContainer>

### Secondary buttons

Used for actions that aren't so important.
They are usually connected to primary buttons.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A modal to find accommodation, with a primary button to 'Find a room' and a secondary button to 'Close'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:101%3A0)

</ImageContainer>

### Critical buttons

Used when you need to permanently delete something
or have a critical action that can't be taken back.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A dialog asking to confirm account deletion with a critical button to 'Delect account' and a secondary button to 'Cancel'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:101%3A52)

</ImageContainer>

### Critical subtle buttons

Used mainly as complementary buttons to critical ones.
They're often used as a step before permanent deletion,
so they're visually less important than critical buttons.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A screen with details on a traveler, with a critical subtle button at the button to 'Delete traveler'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:105%3A2047 "This is followed by a dialog confirming the deletion with a critical button (not a subtle one).")

</ImageContainer>

### White buttons

Used in settings where the background is darker than usua
and normal buttons wouldn't work,
such as a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/) or a [picture card](/components/visuals/picturecard/).

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A dark tooltip with some text and a white button to 'Learn more'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:111%3A1400)

</ImageContainer>

## Alert buttons

Alert buttons should be used **only in [alerts](/components/information/alert/)**.

Each alert time has a basic button type (used in place of a primary button)
and a subtle button type (used in place of a secondary button).
There should be no more than _one basic and one subtle button_.
(See [alignment guidance below](#button-alignment-in-alert).)

<ReactExample exampleId="Alert-actions_sidebyside" />

## ButtonLinks

Choose a button link when it is outside text, the text inside is short,
and either of the following is true:

- The action navigates inside the app.
- The action is an interaction, like opening a modal or submitting a form.

Inside text and for external navigation, use only [text links](#textlinks).

ButtonLinks come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_) and three types:

- [Primary](#primary-buttonlinks)
- [Secondary](#secondary-buttonlinks)
- [Critical](#critical-buttonlinks)

### Primary ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **primary buttons**
or as a primary standalone action that is visually less heavy than **primary subtle buttons**.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A modal with a form for places to visit, a primary button to 'Search journey', and a primary button link to 'Add destination'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:104%3A180)

</ImageContainer>

### Secondary ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **secondary buttons** or as a secondary standalone action.
Often used for filters.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A search filter with a list of carriers that is incomplete and a secondary button link to 'Show all carriers'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:104%3A36)

</ImageContainer>

### Critical ButtonLinks

Great as complements to **critical buttons**
or as a secondary standalone action that is visually less heavy than **critical subtle buttons**.

<ImageContainer size="medium">

![A form to edit payment card details with a secondary button to 'Close' and a critical button link to 'Delete card'.](fileId:fannvRpkOJK6uxxT33EKaa;nodeId:105%3A2185 "This can be followed by a confirmation dialog with a critical button.")

</ImageContainer>

## TextLinks

Choose a text link in any of these cases:

- The action is inside text.
- The action is less important and navigates outside the app.
- The text inside the action is long.

Our main TextLinks come in three sizes (_large_, _normal_, and _small_) and two types:

- Primary
- Secondary

All types can be external to navigate to external pages.
These links automatically open in a new window with extra security attributes.

**_Primary TextLinks_** are used for primary actions inside of text (a paragraph).

**_Secondary TextLinks_** are used for secondary actions inside of text (a paragraph).

## Button alignment

**_Primary buttons_** always appear to the right.
_Secondary buttons_ appear to the left of the primary button.
Depending on the context, you can use _primary subtle buttons_ on either the left or right side.

### Button alignment in Alert

**Standalone buttons** should always be aligned to the left.
If you have **multiple buttons**, align all buttons to the left.
**Primary buttons** should be first and then **Secondary** buttons.

If the text in either of the buttons in a two-button layout is too long,
the buttons get placed on separate lines.

The spacing between the buttons should be <InlineToken name="spaceXSmall" />
(you can do this with a [stack component](/components/layout/stack/)).

### Button alignment in Modal

When there is only _one action_ in Modal,
se a **primary subtle button** aligned to the left.
If there are _two actions_,
use **primary buttons** on the right of the modal action area
and **Secondary buttons** on the left.

### Button alignment in Card

The Card action area is on the right of the header
for both mobile and desktop versions.
In this area, we recommend using only a small **primary subtle button**
or a small **secondary button**.
