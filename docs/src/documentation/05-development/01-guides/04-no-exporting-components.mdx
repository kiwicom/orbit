We know that Orbit React components are built upon styled-components,
which allow you to easily extend other existing React components with the styled factory.
Still, we, as Orbit maintainers, don't want to allow it,
even though it would allow many of our developers to develop features easily
with a better developer experience.

Both approaches, allowing such extension and not,
have a lot of pros and cons that have to be considered.
So we would like to clearly state all of them we can and explain our decision clearly.

## Pros

We think the following pros to allowing the extension of Orbit React components are the most important.

### Simpler JSX structure

Given the nature of how styled-components work,
the main benefit would be a simpler JSX structure.
Mainly because of the possibility of extending our components,
developers could attach additional styles in a very easy way. That would mean fewer wrappers with custom overrides.

### Better developer experience with Orbit

We also believe that allowing extension would lead to
a better developer experience when working with Orbit.
Developers would not have to think if our components support a particular use case
and would simply override the behaviour or visual style of our components.

## Cons

On the other hand, we think that allowing the extension of Orbit React components
would bring us and also our frontend developers many cons
that might not manifest immediately, but most probably would in the future.

### Consistency issues

One of our main long-term goals is to ensure consistency across our applications.
We believe that allowing extension would lead to worse consistency
since developers would have a very easy way to implement designs
that might not be aligned with the current possibilities that Orbit provides.
It would lead also to fewer requests for enhancements, new features, and bug fixes
and would slow down the growth of Orbit in some way.

### Dependent on Orbit DOM structure

Most of our components may be considered very simple,
or by some definitions atoms or molecules.
But in reality, their DOM and style structure may not be that simple---as a single DOM element.
So it can be hard to properly extend some Orbit React components
without exact CSS selectors that follow the exact DOM structure.
For the future sustainability and maintainability of our components,
we can't provide or support their DOM structures,
which can be changed with refactoring or major visual updates.

### Would need to document API for all styled-components

If we exported, we would have to document all of the inner styled-components
that make up Orbit React components and have them publicly documented.
This would add unnecessary complexity on our shoulders
and require us to make updates and releases less often.

### New versions would require more work

As said before, having a more public and documented API would mean
that between some minor versions (and major versions once we will release the first major)
it would most likely be harder to release quick updates of the newest version to production
and would require a lot of work in users' repositories.

### Impossibility to lint all overrides and custom styles

As far as we know, there isn't any tooling that would allow us to control or determine
which CSS properties are being used in the extended component and which are being overridden.
So we couldn't transparently support how our components would be used.
This, in the end, could lead to inconsistent behaviour or visual style for our applications,
even though we can't prohibit all possibilities when it comes to custom CSS overrides.

### Extended functionality requires running more JS code

Given the nature of how styled-components work,
allowing extension could lead to unnecessary complexity in UI components
and also more time-consuming runtimes.
The most problematic part is managing the StyleSheetManager context state,
which can be expensive.
And with combinations of multiple extensions, it could lead to performance issues.

### You'd become a maintainer of the UI

Most importantly, allowing extension would mean that you'd be becoming a maintainer of the UI.
We wouldn't be able to provide you with a guarantee over the UI that you need to develop.
You should be responsible only for minor and major layouts that the feature requires
and not for elementary pieces of the UI.
Last but not least, you should spend most of your time on implementing functionality
and not on the UI, which should be consistent in our applications and solved on a systematic level.

Neutral:

- Fewer support requests/fewer versions
- Fewer reports that something doesn't work (bug fixes, features requests)
- Solving topics on design level and systematic approach

## On balance

Overall, for us, allowing the extension of our components
would bring too many drawbacks without enough benefits.
It would mean we would get fewer requests for support and fewer opportunities
to build Orbit into something better with more features and versions.
It would mean we wouldn't be solving issues systematically
and so you would have to spend more of your time solving minor issues.

We understand the lack of flexibility is a drawback.
That's why we've started other initiatives to give you more control
while remaining inside the Orbit design system.
For example, we began introducing primitive components,
which give you all of the same basic functionalities with a lot more control over the visual style.

If there's something that'd you'd like to have control over, let us know,
in [#plz-orbit](https://skypicker.slack.com/archives/CAMS40F7B), on [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/orbit),
or directly in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit).
We want to cover all major use cases and work together to make Orbit the best it can be.
