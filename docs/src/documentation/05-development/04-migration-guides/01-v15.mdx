# Orbit Migration Guide v15

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v14 to v15.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### mediaQueries util function removed

The `mediaQueries` function is no longer available. This was a styled-components util function that is now no longer expected to be used, as we move away from StyledComponents.
If needed, the tokens and breakpoint values are still accessible via the `getBreakpointWidth` function and the `QUERIES` and `TOKEN` constants.
Check [the documentation](/development/utilities/media-queries/) for more information on how to use these.
