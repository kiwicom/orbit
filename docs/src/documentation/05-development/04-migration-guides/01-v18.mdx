# Orbit Migration Guide v18

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v17 to v18.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### `readOnly` prop removed from `Radio` and `Checkbox` components

This prop was deprecated since Orbit 17.1 and is now removed.

The prop was semantically incorrect, since `input` elements with `type="radio"` and `type="checkbox"` cannot be read-only.

A possible alternative is to use the `disabled` prop.
