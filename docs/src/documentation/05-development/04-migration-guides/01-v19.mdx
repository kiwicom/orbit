# Orbit Migration Guide v19

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v18 to v19.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Renaming of `UserSingle` icon

The `UserSingle` icon has been renamed to `UserSingleLight`. No changes have been made to the icon itself, only the name has been changed to better suit its visual aspect.

```diff
- import UserSingle from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/icons/UserSingle";
+ import UserSingleLight from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/icons/UserSingleLight";

...

- <UserSingle />
+ <UserSingleLight />
```

### Removal of `size` prop in InputGroup

Following the removal of the `size` prop from the `InputField` and `Select` components in version 7, the `size` prop in the `InputGroup` component was having no effect at all.
Therefore, it has now been removed.

```diff
- <InputGroup size="small">
+ <InputGroup>
```

### Removal of `inputSize` prop in ErrorFormTooltip

The `inputSize` prop in the `ErrorFormTooltip` component has been removed as it was not being used at all, for the same reason mentioned above.

```diff
- <ErrorFormTooltip inputSize="small" />
+ <ErrorFormTooltip />
```
