# Orbit Migration Guide v19

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v18 to v19.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Renaming of `UserSingle` icon

The `UserSingle` icon has been renamed to `UserSingleLight`. No changes have been made to the icon itself, only the name has been changed to better suit its visual aspect.

**Before:**

```jsx
import UserSingle from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/icons/UserSingle";

<UserSingle />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import UserSingleLight from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/icons/UserSingleLight";

<UserSingleLight />;
```

### Removal of `size` prop in InputGroup

Following the removal of the `size` prop from the `InputField` and `Select` components in version 7, the `size` prop in the `InputGroup` component was having no effect at all.
Therefore, it has now been removed.

### Removal of `inputSize` prop in ErrorFormTooltip

The `inputSize` prop in the `ErrorFormTooltip` component has been removed as it was not being used at all, for the same reason mentioned above.

### Removal of `left` and `right` functions from RTL utils

Deprecated since version 17.1.0, the `left` and `right` functions from the RTL utils have now been removed.

### Removal of deprecated props and tokens

Component props, tokens and tailwind classes deprecated in version 16 have been removed.

Refer to the [migration guide for version 16](/migration-guides/v16/) for an extensive list of removed tokens and classes and their replacements.

Besides the ones mentioned, some other tokens (and classes) were affected, namely component-specific tokens and breakpoint tokens.

The component-specific tokens and classes were not documented and were not expected to be used.
Therefore, the full set of removed tokens and classes is not listed in this migration guide.
The full diff, available on the repository, can provide insights on the replacements for these tokens and classes.

#### Breakpoint tokens renaming

The breakpoint tokens, exported via the `mediaQuery` util and from the `theme` object, have been renamed.
The prefix `width` was removed from their names. Their values did not change.

- `widthBreakpointMediumMobile` -> `breakpointMediumMobile`
- `widthBreakpointLargeMobile` -> `breakpointLargeMobile`
- `widthBreakpointTablet` -> `breakpointTablet`
- `widthBreakpointDesktop` -> `breakpointDesktop`
- `widthBreakpointLargeDesktop` -> `breakpointLargeDesktop`

#### New spacing tokens

Two new spacing tokens were added. One replaces the deprecated `spaceXXXLarge` and the other introduces a new value.
These tokens are available in the `theme` object and the corresponding tailwind classes are also available.
For now, no component props are available for these tokens.

- _(new token)_ -> `space700` (28px)
- `spaceXXXLarge` -> `space1300` (52px)
