# Orbit Migration Guide v20

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v19 to v20.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Required props in HorizontalScroll if `arrows` is true

The `HorizontalScroll` component now requires `arrowLeftAriaLabel` and `arrowRightAriaLabel` props if `arrows` is true.

**Before:**

```jsx
import HorizontalScroll from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/HorizontalScroll";

<HorizontalScroll arrows />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import HorizontalScroll from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/HorizontalScroll";

<HorizontalScroll arrows arrowLeftAriaLabel="Scroll left" arrowRightAriaLabel="Scroll right" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `arrowLeftAriaLabel` and `arrowRightAriaLabel` props.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
// left arrow
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.arrow.scroll_left",
  defaultMessage: "Scroll left",
});
// right arrow
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.arrow.scroll_right",
  defaultMessage: "Scroll right",
});
```

To run the codemod, use the following command:

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicom/orbit/master/packages/orbit-components/transforms/horizontalscroll-aria-labels.js --parser=tsx --extensions=ts,tsx <pathToYourCode>
```

Make sure to run prettier after running the codemod, as it might introduce some formatting changes.

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, but please maintain the same translation key structure (`common.screenreader.*`) when requesting translations.
