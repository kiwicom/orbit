# Orbit Migration Guide v20

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v19 to v20.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Badge component removed the `border` prop

The `Badge` component removed the `border` prop, as it was not being used internally.

Please adapt your code to remove the `border` prop. No visual changes are expected.

**Before:**

```jsx
import Badge from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Badge";

<Badge border={false} />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import Badge from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Badge";

<Badge />;
```

### Required props in HorizontalScroll if `arrows` is true

The `HorizontalScroll` component now requires `arrowLeftAriaLabel` and `arrowRightAriaLabel` props if `arrows` is true.

**Before:**

```jsx
import HorizontalScroll from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/HorizontalScroll";

<HorizontalScroll arrows />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import HorizontalScroll from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/HorizontalScroll";

<HorizontalScroll arrows arrowLeftAriaLabel="Scroll left" arrowRightAriaLabel="Scroll right" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `arrowLeftAriaLabel` and `arrowRightAriaLabel` props.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
// left arrow
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.arrow.scroll_left",
  defaultMessage: "Scroll left",
});
// right arrow
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.arrow.scroll_right",
  defaultMessage: "Scroll right",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, but please maintain the same translation key structure (`common.screenreader.*`) when requesting translations.

### Required prop in Modal if `onClose` is defined and `hasCloseButton` is explicitly false

The `Modal` component used to have a default value for the prop `labelClose`. We removed this default value, so now you need to provide it.
This prop is also now required if `onClose` is defined and `hasCloseButton` is explicitly set to `false` (the default value of `hasCloseButton` prop is still `true`, as it has been).

This `labelClose` prop provides the label for the close button that is applied to the `Modal` so that assistive technologies can announce it correctly, given that it renders a button with just an icon.

**Before:**

```jsx
import Modal from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Modal";

<Modal onClose={handleClose} />;
```

The `labelClose` prop has a default value of `"Close"`. Notice that the `hasCloseButton` prop is undefined, so by default it is set to `true`.

**Now:**

```jsx
import Modal from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Modal";

<Modal onClose={handleClose} labelClose="Close" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `labelClose` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "orbit.button_close",
  defaultMessage: "Close",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by eventually providing more context to the modal it refers to.

## Codemod

A codemod is available to help with the migration. It should target the new props that require (translated) strings.
Please note that the codemod **does not** guarantee a full migration, nor its complete correctness.
Manual checks are still necessary, especially if some props are being calculated conditionally or the components are imported with different names.

To run the codemod, use the following command:

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicom/orbit/master/packages/orbit-components/transforms/aria-labels.js --parser=tsx --extensions=ts,tsx <pathToYourCode>
```

Make sure to run prettier after running the codemod, as it might introduce some formatting changes.
