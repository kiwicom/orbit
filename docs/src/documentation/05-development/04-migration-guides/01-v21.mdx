# Orbit Migration Guide v21

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v20 to v21.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Removal of default Open button in Accordion component

The default `Open` button, which was rendered in the `AccordionSection` component when no `actions` were provided, has been removed.
Feel free to pass an action component in the `actions` prop. Alternatively, by setting `expandOnTileClick` prop to `true` the whole element expands on click.

**Before:**

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionSection header={<Text>Accordion header</Text>}>
</Accordion>
```

**After:**

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionSection
    header={<Text>Accordion header</Text>}
    actions={<Button onClick={() => {}}>Open</Button>}
  >
</Accordion>
```

### Title prop in Drawer component

The `title` prop in the `Drawer` component now only accepts a string.

It used to accept a React node for translations, but this could lead to some unexpected or wrong HTML structure.

This change also allows for the `aria-label` attribute to have the same value as the `title` prop, if `ariaLabel` is not provided.

### Label prop in Collapse component

The `label` prop in the `Collapse` component now only accepts a string.

It used to accept a React node for translations, but this could lead to some unexpected or wrong HTML structure.

### Required prop in Alert component when is `closable`

The `Alert` component now requires the prop `labelClose` when `closable` is `true`.

This prop provides the label for the close button that is applied to the `Alert` so that assistive technologies can announce it correctly, given that it renders a button with just an icon.

**Before:**

```jsx
import Alert from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Alert";

<Alert closable />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import Alert from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Alert";

<Alert closable labelClose="Close" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `labelClose` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "orbit.button_close",
  defaultMessage: "Close",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by eventually providing more context to the alert it refers to.

### Required props in Collapse component

The `Collapse` component now requires the props `expandButtonLabel` and `collapseButtonLabel`.

They are used to provide accessible labels to the button that toggles the collapse state.

**Before:**

```jsx
<Collapse label="Collapse">
  <Text>Collapse content</Text>
</Collapse>
```

**After:**

```jsx
<Collapse label="Collapse" expandButtonLabel="Expand" collapseButtonLabel="Collapse">
  <Text>Collapse content</Text>
</Collapse>
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `expandButtonLabel` and `collapseButtonLabel` props.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "orbit.collapse_expand",
  defaultMessage: "Expand",
});
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "orbit.collapse_collapse",
  defaultMessage: "Collapse",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by eventually providing more context.

### Required prop in ButtonMobileStore component

The `ButtonMobileStore` component now requires the prop `alt`.

This prop provides the alt text for the image that is displayed in the `ButtonMobileStore` component.

This allows assistive technologies to announce the button correctly, given that it renders an image.

**Before:**

```jsx
<ButtonMobileStore type="appStore" />
<ButtonMobileStore type="googlePlay" />
```

**After:**

```jsx
<ButtonMobileStore type="appStore" alt="Download on the App Store" />
<ButtonMobileStore type="googlePlay" alt="Get it on Google Play" />
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `alt` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.google_play_button",
  defaultMessage: "Get it on Google Play",
});
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.app_store_button",
  defaultMessage: "Download on the App Store",
});
```

Remember that the component also expects a `lang` prop, which is used to determine the language version of the image.

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by eventually providing more context.

## Codemod

A codemod is available to help with the migration. It should target the new props that require (translated) strings.
Please note that the codemod **does not** guarantee a full migration, nor its complete correctness.
Manual checks are still necessary, especially if some props are being calculated conditionally or the components are imported with different names.

To run the codemod, use the following command:

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicom/orbit/master/packages/orbit-components/transforms/aria-labels-v21.js --parser=tsx --extensions=ts,tsx <pathToYourCode>
```

Make sure to run prettier after running the codemod, as it might introduce some formatting changes.
