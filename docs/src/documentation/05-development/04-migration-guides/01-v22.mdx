# Orbit Migration Guide v22

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v21 to v22.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Removal of `helpClosable` prop in ErrorFormTooltip

The `helpClosable` prop in the `ErrorFormTooltip` component has been removed.

Because of that, the `helpClosable` prop was also removed from the components using the `ErrorFormTooltip` component internally, namely:

- `InputField`
- `InputFile`
- `InputGroup`
- `InputSelect`
- `Select`
- `Textarea`

Please adapt your code to remove the `helpClosable` prop from these components. Note that tooltip will still be closable on the outside click or when the associated input element loses focus.

**Before:**

```jsx
import InputField from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputField";

<InputField helpClosable={false} />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import InputField from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputField";

<InputField />;
```
