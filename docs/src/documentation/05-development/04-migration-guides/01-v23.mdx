# Orbit Migration Guide v23

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v22 to v23.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Required node version

Orbit now requires Node.js v22 or higher.

This applies to all Orbit packages, including `orbit-components`, `orbit-design-tokens` and `orbit-tailwind-preset`.

### Removal of ariaLabel prop in NavigationBar

The `NavigationBar` component now renders a `header` element instead of a `nav` element, and the `ariaLabel` prop has been removed.

If you're using `NavigationBar` with `ariaLabel`, you now need to set the `aria-label` attribute on the `nav` element(s) passed as children to `NavigationBar`.

### Removal of aria-label default value in TabList

The `TabList` component used to have a default value for the `aria-label` attribute. We have removed this default value.

You can set this value by passing the `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledby` prop to the `TabList` component.

### Removal of Tooltip prop in Checkbox and Radio

The `tooltip` prop in `Checkbox` and `Radio` components has been removed.

It was not being used in our product and is not supported by the design system anymore.

### Title prop for Skeleton component

The `Skeleton` component used to have a default value for the prop `title`. We have removed this default value.

When `title` prop is provided, it will be rendered as a visually hidden element, but announced by screen readers. When omitted, no text will be announced, which is useful when multiple Skeletons are used together. It's sufficient to have only one Skeleton with the `title` prop in such cases.

**Before:**

```jsx
import Skeleton from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Skeleton";

<Skeleton />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import Skeleton from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Skeleton";

<Skeleton title="Loading" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `title` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.loading",
  defaultMessage: "Loading",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by providing more specific context to the object it refers to.

### Required prop labelRemove in InputFile

The `InputFile` component used to have a value for the file remove button. We removed this value, so now you need to provide it via required `labelRemove` prop.

This `labelRemove` prop provides the label for the remove button so that assistive technologies can announce it correctly, given that it renders a button with just an icon.

**Before:**

```jsx
import InputFile from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputFile";

<InputFile fileName="document.pdf" onRemoveFile={handleRemove} />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import InputFile from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputFile";

<InputFile fileName="document.pdf" onRemoveFile={handleRemove} labelRemove="Remove file" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `labelRemove` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.remove_file.button",
  defaultMessage: "Remove file",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, but please maintain the same translation key structure (`common.screenreader.*`) when requesting translations.

### Required prop labelClear in InputSelect

The `InputSelect` component used to have a value for the selected value remove button. We removed this value, so now you need to provide it via required `labelClear` prop.

This `labelClear` prop provides the label for the clear button so that assistive technologies can announce it correctly, given that it renders a button with just an icon.

**Before:**

```jsx
import InputSelect from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputSelect";

<InputSelect options={options} />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import InputSelect from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputSelect";

<InputSelect options={options} labelClear="Clear value" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `labelClear` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.screenreader.clear_value.button",
  defaultMessage: "Clear value",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, but please maintain the same translation key structure (`common.screenreader.*`) when requesting translations.

### Prop name change in Stepper and StepperStateless

The prop name has been changed from `ariaLabelledBy` to `ariaLabelledby` in the Stepper and StepperStateless components to align with the correct ARIA attribute naming convention.

**Before:**

```jsx
<Stepper ariaLabelledBy="label-id" />
<StepperStateless ariaLabelledBy="label-id" />
```

**Now:**

```jsx
<Stepper ariaLabelledby="label-id" />
<StepperStateless ariaLabelledby="label-id" />
```

Feel free to use the codemod to update the prop name in your code.

## Codemod

A codemod is available to help with the migration. Please note that the codemod **does not** guarantee a full migration, nor its complete correctness.
Manual checks are still necessary, especially if some props are being calculated conditionally or the components are imported with different names.

To run the codemod, use the following command:

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicom/orbit/master/packages/orbit-components/transforms/transforms-v23.js --parser=tsx --extensions=ts,tsx <pathToYourCode>
```

Make sure to run prettier after running the codemod, as it might introduce some formatting changes.
