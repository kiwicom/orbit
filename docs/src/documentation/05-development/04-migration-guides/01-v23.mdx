# Orbit Migration Guide v23

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v22 to v23.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Required node version

Orbit now requires Node.js v22 or higher.

This applies to all Orbit packages, including `orbit-components`, `orbit-design-tokens` and `orbit-tailwind-preset`.

### Removal of ariaLabel prop in NavigationBar

The `NavigationBar` component now renders a `header` element instead of a `nav` element, and the `ariaLabel` prop has been removed.

If you're using `NavigationBar` with `ariaLabel`, you now need to set the `aria-label` attribute on the `nav` element(s) passed as children to `NavigationBar`.

### Removal of Tooltip prop in Checkbox and Radio

The `tooltip` prop in `Checkbox` and `Radio` components has been removed.

It was not being used in our product and is not supported by the design system anymore.

### Title prop for Skeleton component

The `Skeleton` component used to have a default value for the prop `title`. We have removed this default value.

When `title` prop is provided, it will be rendered as a visually hidden element, but announced by screen readers. When omitted, no text will be announced, which is useful when multiple Skeletons are used together. It's sufficient to have only one Skeleton with the `title` prop in such cases.

**Before:**

```jsx
import Skeleton from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Skeleton";

<Skeleton />;
```

**Now:**

```jsx
import Skeleton from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Skeleton";

<Skeleton title="Loading" />;
```

Make sure to provide translated strings for the `title` prop.

To ease the migration, we provide a codemod to help you out, with some default generic translations.
The codemod will inject `intl.formatMessage` calls with the default translations, in this case:

```jsx
intl.formatMessage({
  id: "common.loading",
  defaultMessage: "Loading",
});
```

Feel free to customize the translations according to your needs, by providing more specific context to the object it refers to.

### Prop name change in Stepper and StepperStateless

The prop name has been changed from `ariaLabelledBy` to `ariaLabelledby` in the Stepper and StepperStateless components to align with the correct ARIA attribute naming convention.

**Before:**

```jsx
<Stepper ariaLabelledBy="label-id" />
<StepperStateless ariaLabelledBy="label-id" />
```

**Now:**

```jsx
<Stepper ariaLabelledby="label-id" />
<StepperStateless ariaLabelledby="label-id" />
```

Feel free to use the codemod to update the prop name in your code.

## Codemod

A codemod is available to help with the migration. Please note that the codemod **does not** guarantee a full migration, nor its complete correctness.
Manual checks are still necessary, especially if some props are being calculated conditionally or the components are imported with different names.

To run the codemod, use the following command:

```bash
npx jscodeshift -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicom/orbit/master/packages/orbit-components/transforms/transforms-v23.js --parser=tsx --extensions=ts,tsx <pathToYourCode>
```

Make sure to run prettier after running the codemod, as it might introduce some formatting changes.
