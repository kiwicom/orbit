# Orbit Migration Guide v25

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v24 to v25.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide, we aim to walk through all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortlessly.

## Breaking changes

### Required prop in Icon component

The `Icon` component now requires you to pass either the `ariaLabel` or `ariaHidden` prop.

With this, we enforce accessibility by requiring all icons to have either a label or be hidden from screen readers.

**Before:**

```jsx
<Icon />
```

**Now:**

```diff
<Icon ariaLabel="Close" />

// Or

<Icon ariaHidden />
```

Refer to the [Icon accessibility documentation](/components/icon/accessibility/) for more information.
