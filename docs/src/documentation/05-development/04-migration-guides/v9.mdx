# Orbit Migration Guide v9

This migration guide focuses on the process of migrating from Orbit v8.1.2 to v9.0, as some breaking changes were introduced.
With this guide we aim to walkthrough all the breaking changes and how they can be addressed, allowing the migration to be smoother and effortless.

This version of Orbit is **still** compatible with React 17 and doesn't make use of new features only available in React 18.

That being said, because v9 now recommends using React 18, some changes are required to allow for this transition.

## Breaking changes

### `react-uid` vs React.useId

React 18 introduces this new hook to generate stable random ids called `useId`, while Orbit used to rely on `react-uid` for that purpose.

`react-uid` is not compatible with React 18 (especially when Strict or Concurrent modes are enabled) and as a result was removed from Orbit's dependencies.

The need to generate random ids is still present, however.

Orbit v9 introduces a new prop on `OrbitProvider` called `useId`.

- **React 18**: if you are using React 18, please pass in `React.useId`, e.g.

  ```tsx
  import * as React from "react";

  export const Root = (props: Props) => {
    return (
      <OrbitProvider theme={theme} useId={React.useId}>
        {children}
      </OrbitProvider>
    );
  };
  ```

- **React 17**: if you are using React 17, you will need to:

  - install `react-uid` in your dependencies (`yarn add react-uid`)
  - pass `react-uid`'s `useRandomId` export in the `useId` prop, as well as mounting two providers (`UIDReset` and `UIDFork`), like so

  ```tsx
  import { useRandomId, UIDReset, UIDFork } from "react-uid";

  export const Root = (props: Props) => {
    return (
      <UIDReset>
        <UIDFork>
          <OrbitProvider theme={theme} useId={useRandomId}>
            {children}
          </OrbitProvider>
        </UIDFork>
      </UIDReset>
    );
  };
  ```

One more note: the underlying implementation for how ids are generated is slightly different now. In particular, Orbit's `useRandomIdSeed` no longer relies on `react-uid`'s `useUIDSeed`.
