We treat everyone with **respect** and **without prejudice**.
Our diversity and inclusivity is our **strength**:
it allows us to have ideas and solve problems from different perspectives
and it increases competitiveness, creativity, and collaboration.

## Use cross-cultural expressions

<Exchange size="large" />

Write to be understood **no matter what** the reader's cultural background is.
Your content might be read by people who might be reading English
as a second (or third or fourth ...) language and it might be translated.

### Minimize your use of idioms

Idioms are often based on a particular culture
and tend not be hard for people from other cultures to understand.
Write using more **universal language**.

### Avoid slang

Slang can be harder for people with English as a second language to understand.

## Be inclusive

<GenderWoman size="large" />

We write so everyone feels a part of what we are saying.
Make sure your writing includes everyone in its defaults.

### Use gender-neutral language

Using language that sets the default to male can make people feel excluded.
Use terms that include everyone, such as genderless terms.
Feel free to use "they" in the singular for people of unknown gender.

</Dont>

### Focus on people, not characteristics

Make exceptions for groups who prefer identity-first descriptions.

## Write accessibly

<Wheelchair size="large" />

Make sure everything you write is [accessible](/foundation/accessibility/) to everyone.
Remember that **not everyone will see** your visual content,
so communicate the message in **various ways**.

- Include various **fallbacks** for your content.
- Use emojis/images/and so on to make your textual content **more interesting**,
  but **don't replace** words.
