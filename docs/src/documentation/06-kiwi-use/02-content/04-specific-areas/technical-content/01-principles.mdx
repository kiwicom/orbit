# Technical content

How we produce technical content at Kiwi.com.

## Goal

These guidelines exist to **help you** create content.
Not to point out problems or make you feel bad for not meeting some standard.

The idea is to **free** you from having to worry about details
so you can create **helpful** documentation.
Instead of spending time agonizing over April 1 vs.
1 April, you can **focus on writing** something people will read and use.

If you find the guidelines too constraining
or you're missing guidance on something particular,
let us know!

## Why write docs

We write documentation so that what we create will actually be **used**.

For your project to be used, people have to know:

- **Why** it exists
- How get it **set up**
- How to **use** it

Docs represent an ideal way to get people to understand **why** and **how** to use what you're building.

One thing to keep in mind is that the person who may need to know how your project works
could be **you** in six months.
After you leave a project,
you might not remember all of the decisions you made and why you made them.
Having clear documentation will help make sure you don't lose your valuable insights to time.

## Audiences

It's always important to keep in mind **who** you're writing **for**.
Each reader will have specific **expectations** and **context** when reading your docs.

Some examples of possible audiences and their expectations:

- External users
  - Will have very little context
  - May need more information
- Developers
  - Probably want technical information
  - Might not know the details of this specific project
- Project managers
  - Probably don't want much technical information
  - Might be browsing for understanding the concept

These are just examples and might not be universal.
Before you start writing, you want to ask yourself questions about your readers such as:

- Are they **new** to this project area?
  Do they have **experience** with it?
- **Why** will they be reading?
  To accomplish a **task**?
  **To learn** about the project?
- Will this document come in the middle of something they're in a **hurry** to finish?
  How are they likely to be **feeling** when starting to read?

The answers to these questions will give you a better idea of how to present your information.
You'll have a good idea of how to structure your document.
