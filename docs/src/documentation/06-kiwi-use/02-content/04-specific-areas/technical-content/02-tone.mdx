At Kiwi.com, we speak with one voice.
That voice is a [blend of our core principles](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/).Â 

When producing technical content,
usually the most important principle will be that we are [straightforward](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/straightforward/).
It is important for our technical writing to be clear and understandable.

At the same time, our other principles are still important.
Our [empathy](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/empathetic/) can be seen
in how we [think of our audience while writing](/for-kiwi/content/technical-content/#audiences).
We are also still [passionate](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/passionate/)---even in technical writing.

This means there can be specific times
when some **emotion** and **personality** makes sense in technical writing.
For example, when describing the purpose of a service,
you want to make people **feel how useful** it can be.

There are also times when **some** **humor** can help people process the technical content.
For example, everything in our [FinTech](https://kiwi.wiki/finance/) tribe relates back to ducks.
This is a specific kind of humor that makes that tribe run.

**Be careful** when introducing humor.
Most humor is based around a specific culture and might **not make sense** to people outside of it.
Make sure your writing meets the core principle of [being inclusive](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/inclusive/#be-inclusive).
