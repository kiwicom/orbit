There are at least [four types of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/)
(the link includes a video talk on the types).
They all focus on different things:

- **Tutorials**: teaching the basics to people without previous experience
- **How-to guides**: helping people with some knowledge complete a specific task
- **Reference**: describing information in detail
- **Explanations**: helping people understand the reasons behind the project

Each of these types has different goals.
To decide which to write,
it helps to [know who you are writing for](/for-kiwi/content/technical-content/#audiences).

For each type, you want to pick a specific topic with a specific goal
and write **only about that topic**.
Use links to give people access to additional context and related topics.

When you know the specific topic,
give it a **short** title to make it clear what the document will contain.
For most types, the title should emphasize the action
("Making a reservation", "Deploying your app to Kubernetes").

How-to guides should **not** include "How to" in the title.
Explanations can (but don't have to) include
actions emphasizing their type (such as "Understanding")
or nouns describing the topic ("Baggage overview").

For each type, the document should include a **brief introduction** describing its purpose.
It should be clear **who** the doc is written for
and **what** they should get out of reading it.

Always include **clear headings** to structure your document into clear sections.

## Tutorials

The introduction should include **why** the given product or service is **important**.

Then the tutorial should guide the reader through an ordered **series of steps**
that will teach them the basics of how to accomplish something.

## How-to guides

The introduction should make it clear **what** users can **accomplish** with the guide
**and why** they'd want to do so.

The guide should continue with clear, **ordered steps** for accomplishing the task.
Put any information that is not immediately useful to accomplishing the task **elsewhere**,
such as in a reference guide, and **add a link** to it..

## Reference guides

The introduction should explain **what** information is **included** in the guide
and **why** it might be **useful**.

The rest of the guide should be information that is **clearly structured**
without many details on why or how to accomplish something.
Include links to specific how-to guides when relevant.

## Explanations

The introduction should include **why** the reader should be **interested**
in learning more about the given topic.

It should then continue with more **general discussion**,
taking a **higher-level** perspective on the topic.
Any technical information should be placed in a **separate** reference guide and linked to.
Any tasks should be given **separate** how-to guides and linked to.
