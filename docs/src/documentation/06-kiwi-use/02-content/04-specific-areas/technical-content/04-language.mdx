title: Language
---

In general,
follow the guidelines in the [grammar and mechanics](/for-kiwi/content/grammar-and-mechanics/) section.
If you come across anything not addressed there or here,
use the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) as a reference.

## Address the reader directly

Use the second person and tell users what to do.
Be clear and to the point.

Unless there is a very good reason to do so, avoid using "we" and "our".

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Click the button
- If you're going to deploy the cluster/When deploying the cluster
- To get started fast, use the default settings.

</Do>

<Dont>

- Let's click the button
- If we're going to deploy the cluster
- We recommend that you use our default settings to get started fast.

</Dont>
</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Tenses

In most [types of documentation](/for-kiwi/content/technical-content/structure/),
especially in how-to guides, readers will be following the instructions as they read.
Use the present tense to describe actions.
Similarly, avoid "would" and "could"
(and any other modals expressing uncertainty) in conditional statements.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Click the button and the window displays
- Send a GET request to the endpoint. The server responds with a JSON object.
- If you send a request, the server responds with a JSON object.

</Do>

<Dont>

- Click the button and the window will display
- Send a GET request to the endpoint. The server will respond with a JSON object.
- You can send a request. The server would respond with a JSON object.

</Dont>
</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Creating links

When inserting links into the text,
try to give them descriptive text (not just the URL).
Make exceptions for API endpoints when the purpose of including the link is
to show the location of the endpoint.

Also avoid phrases such as "click here".
Have the text make sense out of context---when you're looking just at the link text.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- See a \[description of X\]\(link\)
- \[More info\]\(link\)

</Do>

<Dont>

- To see a description of X, \[click here\]\(link\)
- More info \[here\]\(link\)

</Dont>
</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Don't personify systems

Keep computers and systems as inanimate things
and attribute as few human qualities to them as possible.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- The server communicates to the client that it's received the request.
- The app detects when you've entered the airport.
- If you format the request badly, the server rejects it.

</Do>

<Dont>

- The server tells the client when it's received the request.
- The app sees when you've entered the airport.
- If you format the request badly, the server will refuse to accept it.

</Dont>
</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Be specific

Always be specific about what you're referring to.
If you introduce a specific product in the first sentence of a section,
don't assume the reader will know what you mean by "it" two paragraphs
(or even two sentences later).

Repeat your references to make it clear what you are talking about.

Any time you have long strings of nouns, break them up into smaller pieces
o it's clear what refers to what.

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- Call Refund Calculator to get the refundable amount.
- Check the type of refund in the response from Refund Calculator.
- Draft instructions for the default settings of the application

</Do>

<Dont>

- Call it to get the refundable amount.
- Check the type of refund in the response.
- Draft default application settings instructions

</Dont>
</GuidelinesSideBySide>

## Order steps (and nothing else)

Numbered lists are a great sign to readers that steps need to be completed in a given order.
They make it clear what steps need to be done when.

Don't weaken this guidance by numbering other things where the order doesn't matter.
For example, headings in an article should follow a clear semantic structure.
That structure should be enough, so the headings should not be numbered.

## Use contractions

In keeping with our being [empathetic](/for-kiwi/content/voice-and-tone/empathetic/#use-words-and-structures-youd-use-in-speaking),
feel free to use common contractions.
This means writing _can't_ and _isn't_ in place of _cannot_ and _are not_.

It's best to avoid shortening noun and verb combinations where it might be confusing
(such as making readers think something is a possessive rather than a noun and verb).
But common contractions such as _it's_ should be clear (just don't confuse _it's_ and _its_).

<GuidelinesSideBySide>

<Do>

- It isn't true that we can't use contractions.
- The trip is short and convenient.
- It's common to see an error on the first request.
- The returned object includes what its length is.

</Do>

<Dont>

- It is not true that we cannot use contractions.
- The trip's short and convenient.
