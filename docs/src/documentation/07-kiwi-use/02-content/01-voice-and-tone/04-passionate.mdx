Travel connects people and places, bringing **new experiences** into their lives.
We help people **connect** and **create meaningful relationships** with the world
by demonstrating our passion for travel.

It's important to keep in mind that this passion needs to be balanced with our other principles.
In domains like technical writing, **too much passion** makes the text **less clear**.
And of course, positive passion isn't [appropriate in every situation](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone//empathetic/#adapt-tone-to-the-situation).

So while we're always passionate about what we do,
we remember to **express** that passion **appropriately**.

## Use positive language

<ThumbUp size="large" />

Use words and structures that bring out **positive** **emotions**.
Focus on what **can** and **should** be done rather than what can't and shouldn't.

Also be **careful with negation** in English.
This includes negative words for positive situations and double negatives.
Both of these can be misunderstood.

## Use active language

<SportEquipment size="large" />

Try to make your sentences seem alive and moving.
This means focusing on active structures
(verbs with a clear subject where you can't add "by kiwis" to the end of the verb
and have it make sense).

In most cases, avoid passive structures.
But do use them when it makes the idea clearer
(such as to avoid personifying a system) and to avoid blaming users for errors.

## Be engaging

<Leisure size="large" />

When there's room, use colorful adjectives.

Spice up your texts with words like **amazing** and **brilliant**.
But remember that they lose power when overused.

Don't water them down by using them to describe what we offer ("our amazing features"),
but limit them to engaging opportunities [for users](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone//empathetic/#keep-focus-on-users).
