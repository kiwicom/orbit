## Guidelines

### Guideline do

<Guideline type="do" title="Use secondary small buttons for additional actions on the page">

The secondary small button is great for actions in [cards](/components/structure/card/)
as it stands out from the interface but doesn't take so much attention.

</Guideline>

### Guideline don't

<Guideline type="dont" title="Don’t use Product colors to highlight information">

Because Product colors are used for actions,
it may cause confusion when they're used to highlight some information or text.

</Guideline>

### Guideline with one image

<Guideline type="dont" title="Don't combine with text link">

If you'd like to have an action, consider an [alert](/components/information/alert/)
or a [button](/components/action/button/) instead.

![An alert with the message "your booking failed" and a button labeled "get details".](../images/examples/Badge-w-action.png)

</Guideline>

<Guideline type="do" title="Have one primary action ">

Every screen should have only one button that represents the most important action:
leading the user to the next step.

![One primary button on a screen stands out.](../images/examples/One-primary-action.png)

</Guideline>

### Guideline with only image and title

<Guideline type="dont" title="Don't combine with text link">

![An alert with the message "your booking failed" and a button labeled "get details".](../images/examples/Badge-w-action.png)

</Guideline>

### Guideline with two images

<Guideline type="dont" title="Don't combine with text link">

If you'd like to have an action, consider an [alert](/components/information/alert/)
or a [button](/components/action/button/) instead.

![An alert with the message "your booking failed" and a button labeled "get details".](../images/examples/Badge-w-action.png)

![A badge with the text: "Booking failed. Get details."" The second sentence is a link.](../images/examples/Alert-w-action.png)

</Guideline>

<Guideline type="do" title="Have one primary action ">

Every screen should have only one button that represents the most important action:
leading the user to the next step.

![One primary button on a screen stands out.](../images/examples/One-primary-action.png)

![Too many primary buttons confuse users.](../images/examples/Too-many-primary-actions.png)

</Guideline>

### Guideline images with separate descriptions
