### Use labels

Labels serve to clearly present what is expected.
They are especially important for [people who won't see other visual cues](/foundation/accessibility/).
But they also help everyone know exactly what to enter.

For the label, use short descriptive phrases,
ideally nouns that make the request clear.
See our [patterns for form labels](/content/glossary/#form-labels) for some examples.
