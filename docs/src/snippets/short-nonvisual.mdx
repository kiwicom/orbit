### Include non-visual information

<p>
  {`${props.visual.replace(/^\w/, c => c.toUpperCase())}s`} can create important context for users,
  but{" "}
  <a href="/foundation/accessibility/" aria-label="accessibility">
    not everyone sees the {props.visual}
  </a>
  . So make sure everything necessary is presented in a non-visual form.
</p>

  {props.version !== 2 && (
    <p>
      This can mean including the name of the {props.associated} with the {props.visual} so anyone
      who doesn't see the {props.visual} still gets the name. But if the {props.visual} is present
      next to text with the name, don't include the name with the {props.visual} so it's not
      repeated.
    </p>
  )}
</>

<>
  {props.version === 2 && (
    <p>
      By default, the {props.visual} comes with alternative text that's the same as the name of the{" "}
      {props.associated}. Check to make sure that this information is meaningful and not
      unnecessarily repeated.
    </p>
  )}
