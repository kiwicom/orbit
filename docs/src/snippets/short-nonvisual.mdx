### Include non-visual information

<p>
  {props.visual.replace(/^\w/, c => c.toUpperCase()) + "s"} can create important context for users,
  but <a href="/foundation/accessibility/">not everyone will see the {props.visual}</a>. So make
  sure everything necessary is presented in a non-visual form.

  {props.version !== 2 && (
    <p>
      This can mean including the name of the {props.associated} with the {props.visual} so anyone
      who doesn't see the {props.visual} will still get the name. But if the {props.visual} is
      present next to text with the name, don't include the name with the {props.visual} so it's not
      repeated.
    </p>

  {props.version === 2 && (
    <p>
      By default, the {props.visual} comes with alternative text that's the same as the name of the{" "}
      {props.associated}. Check to make sure that this information is meaningful and not
      unnecessarily repeated.
