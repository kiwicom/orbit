### Maintain visual hierarchy

<p>
  {props.component.replace(/^\w/, c => c.toUpperCase()) + "s"} are open to any content you want to
  put into them. If you're putting a heading into a {props.component}, we recommend using the{" "}
  {props.component} title, which was designed for this purpose. Or at least use the same style of
  heading to keep the overall visual hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
  Using different styles can create conflicting visual messages, especially if you're using multiple{" "}
  {props.component + "s"} on the same screen.
