		"description": "1. When buttons have an *href* prop, they are automatically rendered as <a> elements. 2. You can override this using an *asComponent* prop. (Just note you need to provide the function yourself and you should specific the role of the button.) 3. Buttons marked as *external* automatically open in a new window with *noopener noreferrer* as the *rel* attribute for security."
