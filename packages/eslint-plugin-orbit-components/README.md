## Supported Rules

- [button-has-title](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/button-has-title.md): Enforces that `Button` and `ButtonLink` do have either `children` or `title` property.
- [unnecessary-text](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/unnecessary-text.md): Enforces that children of `Button` or `Heading` are not wrapped in `Text` component.
- [default-theme](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/default-theme.md):
  This rule aims to prevent the wrong usage of the defaultTheme object from @kiwicom/orbit-components
- [no-custom-colors](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/no-custom-colors.md):
  Prevents inconsistencies between Orbit and custom colors
- [no-custom-typography](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/no-custom-typography.md): This rule aims to prevent the usage of custom values for font-size, font-family and line-height CSS properties. Only some of the design tokens from @kiwicom/orbit-design-tokens should be used as a value.
- [prefer-single-destructure](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/prefer-single-destructure.md): Using too many arrow functions in interpolations can harm performance - because they have to be evaluated with execution context. This is done internally by wrapping all functions into the css helper from styled-components
- [rtl-utils](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/rtl-utils.md):
  Prevents bad theme.rtl patterns. Users often make the same mistake, they tend to use `theme.rtl` to apply RTL styles like right/left position, margins, and paddings. This rule should prevent such cases and enforce the usage of our RTL utility functions.
- [unique-id](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/unique-id.md):
  Rule prevents namespace collisions of the `id` HTML attribute. It often happens, that some elements can have the same ids. To prevent it in our codebase, it's better to use `randomID` utility function.
- [use-rtl](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-orbit-components/docs/rules/use-rtl.md):
  This rule aims to prevent RTL mistakes. A user can forget about RTL and use only static values, this rule should help to avoid that.
