Some\n          people will go through all of your content in the order it’s\n          presented, which often means having to navigate through the same menus\n          on every single page.\n        </CardSection>\n        <CardSection>\n          SkipNavigation components at the top of pages offer these people the\n          option to skip past the repeated content and get right to the primary\n          actions on the given page.
