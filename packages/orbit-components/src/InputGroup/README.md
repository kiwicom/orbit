# InputGroup

To implement InputGroup component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```jsx
import InputGroup from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputGroup";
import InputField from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/InputField";
import Select from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Select";
```

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```jsx
<InputGroup>
  <InputField />
  <Select />
</InputGroup>
```

## Props

## Functional specs

- `error` or `help` defined on children will be displayed to user from left to right, only one error at a time will be displayed until resolved.

- The `error` prop overwrites the `help` prop, due to higher priority.

- Define `error` or `help` only for the **InputGroup**. Any `error` or `help` in InputField or Select won't be displayed.

- You can set up different `flex` attribute for every children, or use one for all. See [flex property docs](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex.asp) for more information.

- The color of the label will turn into cloud shade when all children have some filled value.

- If the passed children into the InputGroup won't have any callbacks - either `onChange`, `onFocus` or `onBlur`, the passed callback of the InputGroup will be used.

- Define `size` only for the **InputGroup**, it will set up the proper styling for everything automatically.

- `onBlurGroup`: In comparison to onBlur, which is triggered by every blur event of InputGroup's children, onBlurGroup treats children as a single field, and fires only when a child loses focus and no child gains focus, for example clicking out of InputGroup.
