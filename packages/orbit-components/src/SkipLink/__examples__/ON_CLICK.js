                When designing with accessibility in mind, it&apos;s important to remember that not
                everyone will navigate your pages in the same way. Some people will go through all
                of your content in the order it’s presented, often having to go through irrelevant
                content to get to what they want.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Offer skip links at the start of complex content, such as cards and itinerary
                results with multiple actions within them. Then users who navigate in a non-visual
                way can skip directly to the action they want to take. It can help you satisfy{" "}

                and won’t clutter up your designs for anyone who isn’t using it.

              <Text>
                If you want to skip from the top of a page or you have other actions you want to
                offer at the start, consider a SkipNavigation component.
