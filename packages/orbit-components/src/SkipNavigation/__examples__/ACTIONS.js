                When designing with accessibility in mind, it’s important to remember that not
                everyone will navigate your pages in the same way. Some people will go through all
                of your content in the order it&apos;s presented, which often means having to
                navigate through the same menus on every single page.

              <Text>
                SkipNavigation components at the top of pages offer these people the option to skip
                past the repeated content and get right to the primary actions on the given page. It
                can help you satisfy <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>{" "}
                2.0 Criterion 2.4.1 and won’t clutter up your designs for anyone who isn&apos;t
                using it.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                SkipNavigation components can include other common actions at the start of the page,
                such as submitting feedback or requesting a refund.

              <Text>
                If you want to let users skip past parts of smaller components of the page, consider
                a <TextLink href="https://orbit.kiwi/accessibility/skiplink/">skip link</TextLink>.
