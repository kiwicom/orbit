      When you&apos;re using progressive disclosure, you might have text that you&apos;ve decided is
      too long to display all at once. You don&apos;t want to overwhelm your users, so you want to
      keep it hidden but accessible. Use a Truncate component to make sure your text fits within its
      parent and doesn&apos;t take over your designs.
