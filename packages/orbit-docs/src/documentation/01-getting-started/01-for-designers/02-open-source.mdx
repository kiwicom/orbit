👋 It's so great to see you here!

As you don't have access to Kiwi.com's network and tooling,
we provide our Figma UI kit as files for you to download.

## Figma UI kit

To access our library, duplicate the files you can find at our community profile.

<FancyLink title="Orbit Figma profile" href="https://figma.com/@OrbitByKiwi" icon="figma" />

These appear in your Drafts.
Now you can work with them to create your own designs.

If you have a team plan, you can also use the files as a library.
See the [Figma docs for how to publish the files to a library](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025508373).

<Callout type="warning">

Currently, Figma doesn't provide notifications when our public files are updated.
To make sure you stay up to date, check the _Last updated_ date on the files at our community profile
and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrbitKiwi).

## Font

By default, our libraries use Circular Pro, which isn't an open font.
If you have a license for Circular Pro, you can use Orbit with Circular Pro.

<Callout type="warning">

Don't forget to [buy a license](https://lineto.com/the+fonts/font+categories/text+fonts/circular/) for your domains.

</Callout>

If you don't have a license, you can replace it with Roboto, a free font from Google.
You can [download Roboto from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
