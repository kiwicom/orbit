## Guidelines

For guidelines on how to use the icons, see the [icon component](/components/visuals/icon/).

## Icon colors

You can usually have icons inherit their color from the surrounding text.
If you need a standalone icon, select from a [status color](/foundation/color/#status-colors)
or one of our icon colors:

<Palette colors={["colorIconPrimary", "colorIconSecondary", "colorIconTertiary"]} />

## Using icons

### In Figma

All of our icons are included in our ["\[Orbit\] Icons" Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/wjYAT0sNBXtirEoyKgXUwr/[Orbit]-Icons)
(internal users only).

### In React

<FancyLink title="React implementation" href="/components/visuals/icon/react/" icon="react" />

### In mobile apps

We have an [icon font](http://images.kiwi.com/orbit-icons/orbit-icons-font.zip)
ready for use in mobile apps.
Copy the code of the icon you need and apply where necessary.

<FancyLink
  title="Download the icon font"
  href="http://images.kiwi.com/orbit-icons/orbit-icons-font.zip"
  icon="download"
/>

### Outside our codebase

If you need to use our icons outside of our React environment or mobile apps,
you have 3 options.

- Find the icon you want in the list below and download the SVG or copy its source.
- [Download the entire icon](http://images.kiwi.com/orbit-icons/orbit-svgs.zip) set as a ZIP file.
- Download a PNG file for any icon through the [Orbit icon CDN](/foundation/icons/cdn/).
