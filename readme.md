## Orbit Mission

Orbit aims to bring order and consistency to all of our products and processes. We elevate user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products.

## Installation

`orbit-components` are served as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kiwicom/orbit-components).

Add them to your project by running:

```bash
// with npm
npm install @kiwicom/orbit-components

// with yarn
yarn add @kiwicom/orbit-components
```

Don't forget to install the [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/) `^4.0.0` also.

## Usage

1. Import fonts that are used in orbit-components:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,400i,500,500i,700"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Or via CSS:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,400i,500,500i,700");
```

2. Include any of our components in your project and use it:

```jsx
import Alert from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Alert";

<Alert>Hello World!</Alert>;
```

If you want to use custom theme or dictionary inside your project, it's necessary to wrap your app into `<ThemeProvider>`. See [this document](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit/tree/master/packages/orbit-components/src/ThemeProvider/README.md) for more information.

For live preview check out [Storybook](https://kiwicom.github.io/orbit/) or [orbit.kiwi](https://orbit.kiwi).

You can also try `orbit-components` live on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/designkiwicom/orbit-sandbox).

## Types

Orbit comes with both Flow and Typescript definitions files, so you can choose what fits your project. However, if you work with Typescript, you need to add type for `styled-components`.

```
// with npm
npm install @types/styled-components --save-dev

// with yarn
yarn add @types/styled-components -D
```
