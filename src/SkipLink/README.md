## Functional specs

- SkipLink is visible only on focus.

## Rationale

SkipLink is used to adress [WCAG2.0 Criterion 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html).
The intent of this is to allow people who navigate sequentially through content more direct access to the primary content and common actions of the Web page which can be hidden inside menus or in otherwise complex content.
