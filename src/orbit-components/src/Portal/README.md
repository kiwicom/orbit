# Portal
To implement Portal component into your project you'll need to add the import:
```jsx
import Portal from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/Portal";
```
After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:
```jsx
<Portal>
  // probably Modal
  <Modal />
</Portal>
```
## Props
Table below contains all types of the props available in the Portal component.

| Name          | Type                  | Default         | Description                      |
| :------------ | :---------------------| :-------------- | :------------------------------- |
| children      | `React.Node`          |                 | The content of the Portal to render. [See Functional specs](#functional-specs)
| element       | `string`              | `"modal"`       | The string name of element to be used for the render.

## Functional specs
* `<Portal />` component will render passed children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It means that you have to create `div` element with id `modal` (or whatever you want) in root `html` file. For more info, see [React Portal docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).
