# Grid
The main purpose of the Grid component is to provide compatible version of **CSS Grid for IE10+** that can work only with the old specification of grid properties and options. 

To implement Grid component into your project you'll need to add the import:
```jsx
import Grid from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/utils/Grid";
```
After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:
```jsx
<Grid columns="4fr minmax(256px, 1fr)">
  // you can use your custom components
  <Section>
    Hello world!
  </Section>
  <SideBar>
    I'm content on the right side.
  </SideBar>
</Grid>
```

## Props
Table below contains all types of the props available in the Grid component.

### Media Queries
When you need to specify some different behaviour of the Grid component on different viewport, you can use properties for it.
There are `mediumMobile`, `largeMobile`, `tablet`, `desktop` and `largeDesktop` available and it behaves the same as [mediaQueries](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-components/tree/master/src/utils/mediaQuery) functions.
All this properties - objects have the some own properties and none is required.

| Name          | Type                        | Default         | Description                      |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------- |
| columns       | `string`                    | `"none"`        | Property alias for `grid-template-columns`, [see known limitations](#known-limitations).
| columnGap     | `string`                    |                 | The gap size for `columns`.
| gap           | `string`                    |                 | The gap size for `columns` and `rows`.
| inline        | `boolean`                   | `false`         | If `true`, the Grid will have `display: inline-grid`, otherwise `display: grid`.
| maxWidth      | `string`                    |                 | Alias for the `max-width` property of the Grid component.
| rows          | `string`                    | `"none"`        | Property alias for `grid-template-rows`, [see known limitations](#known-limitations).
| rowGap        | `string`                    |                 | The gap size for `rows`.

## Why should you use this component
By default, `styled-components` does not auto-prefix any of the CSS grid properties, so you would end up in auto-prefixing on your own.
Also it needs to be said that if you want to support IE10+, you have to use only the old specification that has a lot of limitations and does not provide such flexibility as modern one.

The main focus of this component is to provide API that solves the most common issues and gives you a quick way how to start using CSS Grid in your project without worries.

By default, this Grid component solves:
 - Compiling the `repeat` function to old specification
 - Auto-placement of it's children
