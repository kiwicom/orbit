# Grid

The main purpose of the Grid component is to provide a compatible version of **CSS Grid for IE10+** that works with only the old specification of grid properties and options.

To implement the Grid component in your project, add the import:

```jsx
import Grid from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/utils/Grid";
```

Then you can use it:

```jsx
<Grid columns="4fr minmax(256px, 1fr)">
  // You can use your custom components
  <Section>Hello world!</Section>
  <SideBar>I'm content on the right side.</SideBar>
</Grid>
```

### Media Queries

When you need to specify specific behaviours for the Grid component on different viewports, use the appropriate properties.
The component has `mediumMobile`, `largeMobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`, and `largeDesktop`, which behave the same as [mediaQuery](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-components/tree/master/src/utils/mediaQuery) functions.
All of the object for these properties have the same properties and none is required.

## Why you should use this component

By default, `styled-components` does not auto-prefix any CSS grid properties, so you would end up auto-prefixing on your own.
Also, if you want to support IE 10+, you have to use only the old specification, which has a lot of limitations and does not provide the flexibility of modern specification.

The main focus of this component is to provide an API that solves the most common issues and gives you a quick how to start using CSS grids in your project without worries.

By default, this Grid component handles:

- Compiling the `repeat` function to the old specification
- Auto-placement of its children

## Known template limitations

One of the main focuses of this component is to provide a solution for using CSS grids that is compatible with IE 10+, and so there are some limitations.

- Even though the native `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties can contain `line-name`, the Grid component does not support this.
  That means the only suitable format is something like `1fr 200px repeat(3, minmax(200px, 1fr))` – without any names.
  Furthermore, it's not possible to change the order of a column or row based on the viewport.

- The calculation of the auto-placement for IE 10+ relies on a direct count of children.
  That means it's not possible to use `React.Fragment` or any other wrapper, such as a higher-order component, around your child component.
  In other words, the example below will **not** work in IE 10+.

```jsx
import Grid from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/utils/Grid";

import Cell from "./Cell";

const Wrapper = ({ children }) => {
  // some magic
  return children;
};

/*
    The Grid will create auto placement only for one child – the Wrapper component and therefore the placement will be broken in IE 10+.
*/
const Example = () => (
  <Grid columns="1fr 1fr" rows="1fr 1fr">
    <Wrapper>
      <Cell>First column, first row</Cell>
      <Cell>Second column, first row</Cell>
      <Cell>First column, second row</Cell>
      <Cell>Second column, second row</Cell>
    </Wrapper>
  </Grid>
);
```

## Usage

This component works the same way as a native CSS grid, so it expects the same hierarchy when it comes to using children.

For instance, when you want to define a Grid that has two columns and two rows, the complete usage should look like this:

```jsx
import Grid from "@kiwicom/orbit-components/lib/utils/Grid";

// your custom component to fill each cell in the grid
import Cell from "./Cell";

const Example = () => (
  <Grid columns="1fr 1fr" rows="1fr 1fr">
    <Cell>First column, first row</Cell>
    <Cell>Second column, first row</Cell>
    <Cell>First column, second row</Cell>
    <Cell>Second column, second row</Cell>
  </Grid>
);
```
